Gui use:
1. Go to deployable folder.
2. Run this command to install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the python file app.py.
4. Connect to the server at port 5001 to use the app.

Note: We have the 2 models we trained saved locally, but they are too large to upload, so the deployable version uses the pre-trained BERT model.
