look , i did n't want to be a half-blood . if you 're reading this because you think you might be one , my advice is : close this book right now . believe what- ever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth , and try to lead a normal life . being a half-blood is dangerous . it 's scary . most of the time , it gets you killed in painful , nasty ways . if you 're a normal kid , reading this because you think it 's fiction , great . read on . i envy you for being able to believe that none of this ever happened . but if you recognize yourself in these pages — if you feel something stirring inside — stop reading immediately . you might be one of us . and once you know that , it 's only a mat- ter of time before they sense it too , and they 'll come for you . do n't say i did n't warn you . my name is percy jackson . i 'm twelve years old . until a few months ago , i was a boarding student at yancy academy , a private school for troubled kids in upstate new york . am i a troubled kid ? yeah . you could say that . [ 1 ] i could start at any point in my short miserable life to prove it , but things really started going bad last may , when our sixth-grade class took a field trip to manhattan — twenty-eight mental-case kids and two teachers on a yellow school bus , heading to the metropolitan museum of art to look at ancient greek and roman stuff . i know — it sounds like torture . most yancy field trips were . but mr. brunner , our latin teacher , was leading this trip , so i had hopes . mr. brunner was this middle-aged guy in a motorized wheelchair . he had thinning hair and a scruffy beard and a frayed tweed jacket , which always smelled like coffee . you would n't think he 'd be cool , but he told stories and jokes and let us play games in class . he also had this awesome collection of roman armor and weapons , so he was the only teacher whose class did n't put me to sleep . i hoped the trip would be okay . at least , i hoped that for once i would n't get in trouble . boy , was i wrong . see , bad things happen to me on field trips . like at my fifth-grade school , when we went to the saratoga battlefield , i had this accident with a revolutionary war cannon . i was n't aiming for the school bus , but of course i got expelled anyway . and before that , at my fourth-grade school , when we took a behind-the-scenes tour of the marine world shark pool , i sort of hit the wrong lever on the catwalk and our class took an unplanned swim . and the time before that . . . well , you get the idea . [ 21 this trip , i was determined to be good . all the way into the city , i put up with nancy bobofit , the freckly , redheaded kleptomaniac girl , hitting my best friend grover in the back of the head with chunks of peanut butter-and-ketchup sandwich . grover was an easy target . he was scrawny . he cried when he got frustrated . he must 've been held back several grades , because he was the only sixth grader with acne and the start of a wispy beard on his chin . on top of all that , he was crippled . he had a note excusing him from pe for the rest of his life because he had some kind of muscular disease in his legs . he walked funny , like every step hurt him , but do n't let that fool you . you should 've seen him run when it was enchilada day in the cafeteria . anyway , nancy bobofit was throwing wads of sandwich that stuck in his curly brown hair , and she knew i could n't do anything back to her because i was already on probation . the headmaster had threatened me with death by in-school suspension if anything bad , embarrassing , or even mildly entertaining happened on this trip . `` i 'm going to kill her , '' i mumbled . grover tried to calm me down . `` it 's okay . i like peanut butter. `` he dodged another piece of nancy 's lunch . `` that 's it . '' i started to get up , but grover pulled me back to my seat . `` you 're already on probation , '' he reminded me . `` you know who 'll get blamed if anything happens . '' looking back on it , i wish i 'd decked nancy bobofit [ 3 ] right then and there . in-school suspension would 've been nothing compared to the mess i was about to get myself into . mr. brunner led the museum tour . he rode up front in his wheelchair , guiding us through the big echoey galleries , past marble statues and glass cases full of really old black-and-orange pottery . it blew my mind that this stuff had survived for two thousand , three thousand years . he gathered us around a thirteen-foot-tall stone col- umn with a big sphinx on the top , and started telling us how it was a grave marker , a stele , for a girl about our age . he told us about the carvings on the sides . i was trying to listen to what he had to say , because it was kind of inter- esting , but everybody around me was talking , and every time i told them to shut up , the other teacher chaperone , mrs. dodds , would give me the evil eye . mrs. dodds was this little math teacher from georgia who always wore a black leather jacket , even though she was fifty years old . she looked mean enough to ride a harley right into your locker . she had come to yancy halfway through the year , when our last math teacher had a nervous breakdown . from her first day , mrs. dodds loved nancy bobofit and figured i was devil spawn . she would point her crooked finger at me and say , `` now , honey , '' real sweet , and i knew i was going to get after-school detention for a month . one time , after shed made me erase answers out of old math workbooks until midnight , i told grover i did n't [ 4 ] think mrs. dodds was human . he looked at me , real seri- ous , and said , `` you 're absolutely right . '' mr. brunner kept talking about greek funeral art . finally , nancy bobofit snickered something about the naked guy on the stele , and i turned around and said , `` will you shut up ! '' it came out louder than i meant it to . the whole group laughed . mr. brunner stopped his story . `` mr. jackson , '' he said , `` did you have a comment ? '' my face was totally red . i said , `` no , sir . '' mr. brunner pointed to one of the pictures on the stele . `` perhaps you 'll tell us what this picture represents ? '' i looked at the carving , and felt a flush of relief , because i actually recognized it . `` that 's kronos eating his kids , right ? '' `` yes , '' mr. brunner said , obviously not satisfied . `` and he did this because . . . '' `` well ... '' i racked my brain to remember . `` kronos was the king god , and — `` '' god ? '' mr. brunner asked . `` titan , '' i corrected myself . `` and ... he did n't trust his kids , who were the gods . so , um , kronos ate them , right ? but his wife hid baby zeus , and gave kronos a rock to eat instead . and later , when zeus grew up . he tricked his dad , kronos , into barfing up his brothers and sisters — `` '' eeew ! '' said one of the girls behind me. '' — and so there was this big fight between the gods and the titans , '' i continued , `` and the gods won . '' [ 5 ] some snickers from the group . behind me , nancy bobofit mumbled to a friend , `` like we 're going to use this in real life . like it 's going to say on our job applications , 'please explain why kronos ate his kids . ' `` '' and why , mr. jackson , '' brunner said , `` to paraphrase miss bobofit 's excellent question , does this matter in real life ? '' `` busted , '' grover muttered . `` shut up , '' nancy hissed , her face even brighter red than her hair . at least nancy got packed , too . mr. brunner was the only one who ever caught her saying anything wrong . he had radar ears . i thought about his question , and shrugged . `` i do n't know , sir . '' `` i see . '' mr. brunner looked disappointed . `` well , half credit , mr. jackson . zeus did indeed feed kronos a mixture of mustard and wine , which made him disgorge his other five children , who , of course , being immortal gods , had been living and growing up completely undigested in the titan 's stomach . the gods defeated their father , sliced him to pieces with his own scythe , and scattered his remains in tartarus , the darkest part of the underworld . on that happy note , it 's time for lunch . mrs. dodds , would you lead us back outside ? '' the class drifted off , the girls holding their stomachs , the guys pushing each other around and acting like doo- fuses . [ 6 ] grover and i were about to follow when mr. brunner said , `` mr . jackson . '' i knew that was coming . i told grover to keep going . then i turned toward mr. brunner . `` sir ? '' mr. brunner had this look that would n't let you go — intense brown eyes that could 've been a thousand years old and had seen everything . `` you must learn the answer to my question . '' mr. brunner told me . `` about the titans ? '' `` about real life . and how your studies apply to it . '' `` oh . '' `` what you learn from me , '' he said , `` is vitally impor- tant . i expect you to treat it as such . i will accept only the best from you . percy jackson . '' i wanted to get angry , this guy pushed me so hard . i mean , sure , it was kind of cool on tournament days , when he dressed up in a suit of roman armor and shouted : '' what ho ! '' and challenged us , sword-point against chalk , to run to the board and name every greek and roman per- son who had ever lived , and their mother , and what god they worshipped . but mr. brunner expected me to be as good as everybody else , despite the fact that i have dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and i had never made above a c — in my life . no — he did n't expect me to be as good ; he expected me to be better . and i just could n't learn all those names and facts , much less spell them correctly . i mumbled something about trying harder , while mr. brunner took one long sad look at the stele , like he 'd been at this girl 's funeral . he told me to go outside and eat my lunch . the class gathered on the front steps of the museum , where we could watch the foot traffic along fifth avenue . overhead , a huge storm was brewing , with clouds blacker than i 'd ever seen over the city . i figured maybe it was global warming or something , because the weather all across newyork state had been weird since christmas . we 'd had massive snow storms , flooding , wildfires from lightning strikes . i would n't have been surprised if this was a hurri- cane blowing in . nobody else seemed to notice . some of the guys were pelting pigeons with lunchables crackers . nancy bobofit was trying to pickpocket something from a lady 's purse , and , of course . mrs. dodds was n't seeing a thing . grover and i sat on the edge of the fountain , away from the others . we thought that maybe if we did that , everybody would n't know we were from that school — the school for loser freaks who could n't make it elsewhere . `` detention ? '' grover asked . `` nah , '' i said . `` not from brunner . i just wish he 'd lay off me sometimes . i mean — i 'm not a genius . '' grover did n't say anything for a while . then , when i thought he was going to give me some deep philosophical comment to make me feel better , he said , `` can i have your apple ? '' i did n't have much of an appetite , so i let him take it . i watched the stream of cabs going down fifth avenue , and thought about my mom 's apartment , only a little ways uptown from where we sat . i had n't seen her since christmas . i wanted so bad to jump in a taxi and head home . she 'd hug me and be glad to see me , but she 'd be disappointed , too . she 'd send me right back to yancy , remind me that i had to try harder , even if this was my sixth school in six years and i was probably going to be kicked out again . i would n't be able to stand that sad look she 'd give me . mr. brunner parked his wheelchair at the base of the handicapped ramp . he ate celery while he read a paperback novel . a red umbrella stuck up from the back of his chair , making it look like a motorized cafe table . i was about to unwrap my sandwich when nancy bobofit appeared in front of me with her ugly friends — i guess she 'd gotten tired of stealing from the tourists — and dumped her half-eaten lunch in grover 's lap . `` oops . '' she grinned at me with her crooked teeth . her freckles were orange , as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid cheetos . i tried to stay cool . the school counselor had told me a million times , `` count to ten , get control of your temper . '' but i was so mad my mind went blank . a wave roared in my ears . i do n't remember touching her , but the next thing i knew , nancy was sitting on her butt in the fountain , screaming , `` percy pushed me ! '' mrs. dodds materialized next to us . some of the kids were whispering : `` did you see — `` '' — the water — `` '' — like it grabbed her — `` i did n't know what they were talking about . au i knew was that i was in trouble again . as soon as mrs. dodds was sure poor little nancy was okay , promising to get her a new shirt at the museum gift shop , etc. , etc. , mrs. dodds turned on me . there was a tri- umphant fire in her eyes , as if i 'd done something she 'd been waiting for all semester . `` now , honey — `` '' i know , '' i grumbled . `` a month erasing workbooks . '' that was n't the right thing to say . `` come with me , '' mrs. dodds said . `` wait ! '' grover yelped . `` it was me . /pushed her . '' i stared at him , stunned . i could n't believe he was trying to cover for me . mrs. dodds scared grover to death . she glared at him so hard his whiskery chin trembled . `` i do n't think so , mr. underwood , '' she said. '' b ut — `` '' you — will — stay — here . '' grover looked at me desperately . `` it 's okay , man , '' i told him . `` thanks for trying . '' `` honey , '' mrs. dodds barked at me . `` now . '' nancy bobofit smirked . i gave her my deluxe i'll-kill-you-later stare . then i turned to face mrs. dodds , but she was n't there . she was standing at the museum entrance , way at the top of the steps , gesturing impatiently at me to come on . how 'd she get there so fast ? ho ] i have moments like that a lot , when my brain falls asleep or something , and the next thing i know i 've missed something , as if a puzzle piece fell out of the universe and left me staring at the blank place behind it . the school counselor told me this was part of the adhd , my brain misinterpreting things . i was n't so sure . i went after mrs. dodds . halfway up the steps , i glanced back at grover . he was looking pale , cutting his eyes between me and mr. brunner , like he wanted mr. brunner to notice what was going on , but mr. brunner was absorbed in his novel . i looked back up . mrs. dodds had disappeared again . she was now inside the building , at the end of the entrance hall . okay , i thought . she 's going to make me buy a new shirt for nancy at the gift shop . but apparently that was n't the plan . i followed her deeper into the museum . when i finally caught up to her , we were back in the greek and roman section . except for us , the gallery was empty . mrs. dodds stood with her arms crossed in front of a big marble frieze of the greek gods . she was making this weird noise in her throat , like growling . even without the noise , i would 've been nervous . it 's weird being alone with a teacher , especially mrs. dodds . something about the way she looked at the frieze , as if she wanted to pulverize it . . . [ 11 ] '' you 've been giving us problems , honey , '' she said . i did the safe thing . i said , `` yes , ma'am . '' she tugged on the cuffs of her leather jacket . `` did you really think you would get away with it ? '' the look in her eyes was beyond mad . it was evil . she 's a teacher , i thought nervously . it 's not like she 's going to hurt me . i said , `` i 'll — i 'll try harder , ma'am . '' thunder shook the building . `` we are not fools , percy jackson , '' mrs. dodds said . `` it was only a matter of time before we found you out . confess , and you will suffer less pain . '' i did n't know what she was talking about . all i could think of was that the teachers must 've found the illegal stash of candy i 'd been selling out of my dorm room . or maybe they 'd realized i got my essay on tom sawyer from the internet without ever reading the book and now they were going to take away my grade . or worse , they were going to make me read the book . `` well ? '' she demanded . `` ma'am , i do n't . . . '' `` your time is up , '' she hissed . then the weirdest thing happened . her eyes began to glow like barbecue coals . her fingers stretched , turning into talons . her jacket melted into large , leathery wings . she was n't human . she was a shriveled hag with bat wings and claws and a mouth full of yellow fangs , and she was about to slice me to ribbons . then things got even stranger . [ 12 ] mr. brunner , who 'd been out in front of the museum a minute before , wheeled his chair into the doorway of the gallery , holding a pen in his hand . `` what ho , percy ! '' he shouted , and tossed the pen through the air . mrs. dodds lunged at me . with a yelp , i dodged and felt talons slash the air next to my ear . i snatched the ballpoint pen out of the air , but when it hit my hand , it was n't a pen anymore . it was a sword — mr. brunner 's bronze sword , which he always used on tournament day . mrs. dodds spun toward me with a murderous look in her eyes . my knees were jelly . my hands were shaking so bad i almost dropped the sword . she snarled , `` die , honey ! '' and she flew straight at me . absolute terror ran through my body . i did the only thing that came naturally : i swung the sword . the metal blade hit her shoulder and passed clean through her body as if she were made of water . hisss ! mrs. dodds was a sand castle in a power fan . she exploded into yellow powder , vaporized on the spot , leaving nothing but the smell of sulfur and a dying screech and a chill of evil in the air , as if those two glowing red eyes were still watching me . i was alone . there was a ballpoint pen in my hand . mr. brunner was n't there . nobody was there but me . 113 ] my hands were still trembling . my lunch must 've been contaminated with magic mushrooms or some- thing . had i imagined the whole thing ? i went back outside . it had started to rain . grover was sitting by the fountain , a museum map tented over his head . nancy bobofit was still standing there , soaked from her swim in the fountain , grumbling to her ugly friends . when she saw me , she said , `` i hope mrs. kerr whipped your butt . '' i said , `` who ? '' `` our teacher . d u h ! `` i blinked . we had no teacher named mrs. kerr . i asked nancy what she was talking about . she just rolled her eyes and turned away . i asked grover where mrs. dodds was . he said , `` who ? '' but he paused first , and he would n't look at me , so i thought he was messing with me . `` not funny , man , '' i told him . `` this is serious . '' thunder boomed overhead . i saw mr. brunner sitting under his red umbrella , read- ing his book , as if he 'd never moved . i went over to him . he looked up , a little distracted . `` ah , that would be my pen . please bring your own writing utensil in the future , mr. jackson. `` i handed mr. brunner his pen . i had n't even realized i [ 14 ] was still holding it . `` sir , '' i said , `` where 's mrs . dodds ? '' he stared at me blankly . `` who ? '' `` the other chaperone . mrs. dodds . the pre-algebra teacher . '' he frowned and sat forward , looking mildly concerned . `` percy , there is no mrs. dodds on this trip . as far as i know , there has never been a mrs. dodds atyancy academy . are you feeling all right ? '' h5 ] 2 l thrcc old ladies knit f th€ socks of dcath i was used to the occasional weird experience , but usually they were over quickly . this twenty-four/seven hallucina- tion was more than i could handle . for the rest of the school year , the entire campus seemed to be playing some kind of trick on me . the students acted as if they were completely and totally convinced that mrs. kerr — a perky blond woman whom i 'd never seen in my life until she got on our bus at the end of the field trip — had been our pre- algebra teacher since christmas . every so often i would spring a mrs. dodds reference on somebody , just to see if i could trip them up . but they would stare at me like i was psycho . it got so i almost believed them — mrs. dodds had never existed . almost . but grover could n't fool me . when i mentioned the name dodds to him , he would hesitate , then claim she did n't exist . but i knew he was lying . something was going on . something had happened at the museum . i did n't have much time to think about it during the days , but at night , visions of mrs. dodds with talons [ 16 ] and leathery wings would wake me up in a cold sweat . the freak weather continued , which did n't help my mood . one night , a thunderstorm blew out the windows in my dorm room . a few days later , the biggest tornado ever spotted in the hudson valley touched down only fifty miles from yancy academy . one of the current events we studied in social studies class was the unusual number of small planes that had gone down in sudden squalls in the atlantic that year . i started feeling cranky and irritable most of the time . my grades slipped from ds to fs . i got into more fights with nancy bobofit and her friends . i was sent out into the hallway in almost every class . finally , when our english teacher , mr. nicoll , asked me for the millionth time why i was too lazy to study for spelling tests , i snapped . i called him an old sot . i was n't even sure what it meant , but it sounded good . the headmaster sent my mom a letter the following week , making it official : i would not be invited back next year to yancy academy . fine , i told myself . just fine . i was homesick . i wanted to be with my mom in our little apartment on the upper east side , even if i had to go to public school and put up with my obnoxious stepfather and his stupid poker parties . and yet ... there were things ed miss atyancy.the view of the woods out my dorm window , the hudson river in the distance , the smell of pine trees . i d miss grover , who 'd [ 17 ] been a good friend , even if he was a little strange . i worried how he 'd survive next year without me . id miss latin class , too — mr. brunner 's crazy tourna- ment days and his faith that i could do well . as exam week got closer , latin was the only test i stud- ied for . i had n't forgotten what mr. brunner had told me about this subject being life-and-death for me . i was n't sure why , but i 'd started to believe him . the evening before my final , i got so frustrated i threw the cambridge guide to greek mythology across my dorm room . words had started swimming off the page , circling my head , the letters doing one-eighties as if they were riding skateboards . there was no way i was going to remember the difference between chiron and charon , or polydictes and polydeuces . and conjugating those latin verbs ? forget it . i paced the room , feeling like ants were crawling around inside my shirt . i remembered mr. brunner 's serious expression , his thousand-year-old eyes . i will accept only the best from you , percy jackson . i took a deep breath . i picked up the mythology book . i 'd never asked a teacher for help before . maybe if i talked to mr. brunner , he could give me some pointers . at least i could apologize for the big fat f i was about to score on his exam . i did n't want to leave yancy academy with him thinking i had n't tried . i walked downstairs to the faculty offices . most of them were dark and empty , but mr. brunner 's door was ajar . u8 ] light from his window stretching across the hallway floor . i was three steps from the door handle when i heard voices inside the office . mr. brunner asked a question . a voice that was definitely grover 's said `` , . . worried about percy , sir . '' i froze . i 'm not usually an eavesdropper , but i dare you to try not listening if you hear your best friend talking about you to an adult . i inched closer . `` ... alone this summer , '' grover was saying . `` i mean , a kindly one in the school ! now that we know for sure , and they know too — `` '' we would only make matters worse by rushing him , '' mr. brunner said . `` we need the boy to mature more . '' `` but he may not have time . the summer solstice dead- line — '' will have to be resolved without him , grover . let him enjoy his ignorance while he still can . '' `` sir , he saw her . . . . '' `` his imagination , '' mr. brunner insisted . `` the mist over the students and staff will be enough to convince him of that . '' `` sir , i ... i ca n't fail in my duties again . '' grover 's voice was choked with emotion . `` you know what that would mean . '' `` you have n't failed , grover , '' mr. brunner said kindly . `` i should have seen her for what she was . now let 's just worry about keeping percy alive until next fall — `` 119 ] the mythology book dropped out of my hand and hit the floor with a thud . mr. brunner went silent . my heart hammering , i picked up the book and backed down the hall . a shadow slid across the lighted glass of brunner 's office door , the shadow of something much taller than my wheelchair-bound teacher , holding something that looked suspiciously like an archers bow . i opened the nearest door and slipped inside . a few seconds later i heard a slow clop~clop~clop , like muf- fled wood blocks , then a sound like an animal snuffling right outside my door . a large , dark shape paused in front of the glass , then moved on . a bead of sweat trickled down my neck . somewhere in the hallway , mr. brunner spoke . `` nothing , '' he murmured . `` my nerves have n't been right since the winter solstice . '' `` mine neither , '' grover said . `` but i could have sworn . . . '' `` go back to the dorm , '' mr. brunner told him . `` you 've got a long day of exams tomorrow . '' `` do n't remind me . '' the lights went out in mr. brunner 's office . i waited in the dark for what seemed like forever . finally , i slipped out into the hallway and made my way back up to the dorm . grover was lying on his bed , studying his latin exam notes like he 'd been there all night . [ 20 ] '' hey , '' he said , bleary-eyed . `` you going to be ready for this test ? '' i did n't answer . `` you look awful . '' he frowned . `` is everything okay ? '' `` just . . . tired . '' i turned so he could n't read my expression , and started getting ready for bed . i did n't understand what i 'd heard downstairs . i wanted to believe i 'd imagined the whole thing . but one thing was clear : grover and mr. brunner were talking about me behind my back . they thought i was in some kind of danger . the next afternoon , as i was leaving the three-hour latin exam , my eyes swimming with all the greek and roman names i 'd misspelled , mr. brunner called me back inside . for a moment , i was worried he 'd found out about my eavesdropping the night before , but that did n't seem to be the problem . `` percy , '' he said . `` do n't be discouraged about leaving yancy . it 's . . . it 's for the best . '' his tone was kind , but the words still embarrassed me . even though he was speaking quietly , the other kids finish- ing the test could hear . nancy bobofit smirked at me and made sarcastic little kissing motions with her lips . i mumbled , `` okay , sir . '' `` i mean . . . '' mr. brunner wheeled his chair back and forth , like he was n't sure what to say . `` this is n't the right place for you . it was only a matter of time . '' [ 21 ] my eyes stung . here was my favorite teacher , in front of the class , telling me i could n't handle it . after saying he believed in me all year , now he was telling me i was destined to get kicked out . `` right , '' i said , trembling . `` no , no , '' mr. brunner said . `` oh , confound it all . what i 'm trying to say . . . you 're not normal , percy . that 's noth- ing to be — `` '' thanks , '' i blurted . `` thanks a lot , sir , for reminding me . `` percy — `` but i was already gone . on the last day of the term , i shoved my clothes into my suitcase . the other guys were joking around , talking about their vacation plans . one of them was going on a hiking trip to switzerland . another was cruising the caribbean for a month . they were juvenile delinquents , like me , but they were rich juvenile delinquents . their daddies were executives , or ambassadors , or celebrities . i was a nobody , from a fam- ily of nobodies . they asked me what i 'd be doing this summer and i told them i was going back to the city . what i did n't tell them was that i 'd have to get a sum- mer job walking dogs or selling magazine subscriptions , and spend my free time worrying about where i 'd go to school in the fall . [ 22 ] '' oh , '' one of the guys said . `` that 's cool . '' they went back to their conversation as if i 'd never existed . the only person i dreaded saying good-bye to was grover , but as it turned out , i did n't have to . he 'd booked a ticket to manhattan on the same greyhound as i had , so there we were , together again , heading into the city . during the whole bus ride , grover kept glancing ner- vously down the aisle , watching the other passengers . it occurred to me that he 'd always acted nervous and fidgety when we left yancy , as if he expected something bad to happen . before , i 'd always assumed he was worried about getting teased . but there was nobody to tease him on the greyhound . finally i could n't stand it anymore . i said , `` looking for kindly ones ? '' grover nearly jumped out of his seat . `` wha — what do you mean ? '' i confessed about eavesdropping on him and mr. brunner the night before the exam . grover 's eye twitched . `` how much did you hear ? '' `` oh . . . not much . what 's the summer solstice dead- line ? '' he winced . `` look , percy ... i was just worried for you , see ? i mean , hallucinating about demon math teachers . . . '' `` grover — `` '' and i was telling mr. brunner that maybe you were overstressed or something , because there was no such person as mrs. dodds , and . . . '' [ 23 ] '' grover , you 're a really , really bad liar . '' his ears turned pink . from his shirt pocket , he fished out a grubby business card . `` just take this , okay ? in case you need me this sum- mer . the card was in fancy script , which was murder on my dyslexic eyes , but i finally made out something like : g'rover ( t2nc/eru > oot ■/ o^eeper 3£ , f ' j } / r o < x/y£f/ veto fsooj 009-0009 '' what 's half — `` '' do n't say it aloud ! '' he yelped . `` that 's my , um ... sum- mer address .

'' he nodded . `` or ... or if you need me . '' `` why would i need you ? '' it came out harsher than i meant it to . grover blushed right down to his adam 's apple . `` look , percy , the truth is , i — i kind of have to protect you . '' i stared at him . all year long , i 'd gotten in fights , keeping bullies away [ 24 ] from him . i 'd lost sleep worrying that he 'd get beaten up next year without me . and here he was acting like he was the one who defended me . `` grover , '' i said , `` what exactly are you protecting me from ? '' there was a huge grinding noise under our feet . black smoke poured from the dashboard and the whole bus filled with a smell like rotten eggs . the driver cursed and limped the greyhound over to the side of the highway . after a few minutes clanking around in the engine com- partment , the driver announced that we 'd all have to get off . grover and i filed outside with everybody else . we were on a stretch of country road — no place you 'd notice if you did n't break down there . on our side of the highway was nothing but maple trees and litter from pass- ing cars . on the other side , across four lanes of asphalt shimmering with afternoon heat , was an old-fashioned fruit stand . the stuff on sale looked really good : heaping boxes of bloodred cherries and apples , walnuts and apricots , jugs of cider in a claw-foot tub full of ice . there were no cus- tomers , just three old ladies sitting in rocking chairs in the shade of a maple tree , knitting the biggest pair of socks id ever seen . i mean these socks were the size of sweaters , but they were clearly socks . the lady on the right knitted one of them . the lady on the left knitted the other . the lady in the middle held an enormous basket of electric-blue yarn . all three women looked ancient , with pale faces [ 25 ] wrinkled like fruit leather , silver hair tied back in white bandannas , bony arms sticking out of bleached cotton dresses . the weirdest thing was , they seemed to be looking right at me . i looked over at grover to say something about this and saw that the blood had drained from his face . his nose was twitching . `` grover ? '' i said . `` hey , man — `` '' tell me they 're not looking at you . they are , are n't they ? '' `` yeah . weird , huh ? you think those socks would fit me ? `` not funny , percy . not funny at all . '' the old lady in the middle took out a huge pair of scissors — gold and silver , long-bladed , like shears . i heard grover catch his breath . `` we 're getting on the bus , '' he told me . `` come on . '' `` what ? '' i said . `` it 's a thousand degrees in there . '' `` come on ! '' he pried open the door and climbed inside , but i stayed back . across the road , the old ladies were still watching me . the middle one cut the yarn , and i swear i could hear that snip across four lanes of traffic . her two friends balled up the electric-blue socks , leaving me wondering who they could possibly be for — sasquatch or godzilla . at the rear of the bus . the driver wrenched a big chunk of smoking metal out of the engine compartment . the bus shuddered , and the engine roared back to life . [ 26 ] the passengers cheered . `` darn right ! '' yelled the driver . he slapped the bus with his hat . `` everybody back on board ! '' once we got going , i started feeling feverish , as if id caught the flu . grover did n't look much better . he was shivering and his teeth were chattering . `` grover ? '' `` yeah ? '' `` what are you not telling me ? '' he dabbed his forehead with his shirt sleeve . `` percy , what did you see back at the fruit stand ? '' `` you mean the old ladies ? what is it about them , man ? they 're not like . . . mrs. dodds , are they ? '' his expression was hard to read , but i got the feeling that the fruit-stand ladies were something much , much worse than mrs. dodds . he said , `` just tell me what you it saw . `` the middle one took out her scissors , and she cut the yarn. `` he closed his eyes and made a gesture with his fingers that might 've been crossing himself , but it was n't . it was something else , something almost — older . he said , `` you saw her snip the cord . '' `` yeah . so ? '' but even as i said it , i knew it was a big deal . `` this is not happening , '' grover mumbled . he started chewing at his thumb . `` i do n't want this to be like the last time . '' `` what last time ? '' [ 27 ] '' always sixth grade . they never get past sixth . '' `` grover , '' i said , because he was really starting to scare me . `` what are you talking about ? '' `` let me walk you home from the bus station . promise me . this seemed like a strange request to me , but i prom- ised he could . `` is this like a superstition or something ? '' i asked . no answer . `` grover — that snipping of the yarn . does that mean somebody is going to die ? '' he looked at me mournfully , like he was already pick- ing the kind of flowers i 'd like best on my coffin . qrov€r un€xp€ct€dly loses his pants confession time : i ditched grover as soon as we got to the bus terminal . 1 know , i know . it was rude . but grover was freaking me out , looking at me like i was a dead man , muttering `` why does this always happen ? '' and `` why does it always have to be sixth grade ? '' whenever he got upset , graver 's bladder acted up , so i was n't surprised when , as soon as we got off the bus , he made me promise to wait for him , then made a beeline for the restroom . instead of waiting , i got my suitcase , slipped outside , and caught the first taxi uptown . `` east one-hundred-and-fourth and first , '' i told the driver . a word about my mother , before you meet her . her name is sally lackson and she 's the best person in the world , which just proves my theory that the best people have the rottenest luck . her own parents died in a plane crash when she was five , and she was raised by an uncle who did n't care much about her . she wanted to be a novelist , so she spent high school working to save enough money for a college with a good creative-writing program . then her [ 29 ] uncle got cancer , and she had to quit school her senior year to take care of him . after he died , she was left with no money , no family , and no diploma . the only good break she ever got was meeting my dad . i do n't have any memories of him , just this sort of warm glow , maybe the barest trace of his smile . my mom does n't like to talk about him because it makes her sad . she has no pictures . see , they were n't married . she told me he was rich and important , and their relationship was a secret . then one day , he set sail across the atlantic on some important jour- ney , and he never came back . lost at sea , my mom told me . not dead . lost at sea . she worked odd jobs , took night classes to get her high school diploma , and raised me on her own . she never com- plained or got mad . not even once . but i knew i was n't an easy kid . finally , she married gabe ugliano , who was nice the first thirty seconds we knew him , then showed his true colors as a world-class jerk . when i was young . i nick- named him smelly gabe . i 'm sorry , but it 's the truth . the guy reeked like moldy garlic pizza wrapped in gym shorts . between the two of us , we made my mom 's life pretty hard . the way smelly gabe treated her , the way he and i got along . . . well , when i came home is a good example . i walked into our little apartment , hoping my mom would be home from work . instead , smelly gabe was in the living [ 30 ] room , playing poker with his buddies . the television blared espn . chips and beer cans were strewn all over the carpet . hardly looking up , he said around his cigar , `` so , you 're home . `` `` where 's my mom ? '' `` working , '' he said . `` you got any cash ? '' that was it . no welcome back . good to see you . how has your life been the last six months ? gabe had put on weight . he looked like a tuskless walrus in thrift-store clothes . he had about three hairs on his head , all combed over his bald scalp , as if that made him handsome or something . he managed the electronics mega-mart in queens , but he stayed home most of the time . i do n't know why he had n't been fired long before . he just kept on collecting paychecks , spending the money on cigars that made me nauseous , and on beer , of course . always beer . whenever i was home , he expected me to provide his gambling funds . he called that our `` guy secret . '' meaning , if i told my mom , he would punch my lights out . `` i do n't have any cash , '' i told him . he raised a greasy eyebrow . gabe could sniff out money like a bloodhound , which was surprising , since his own smell should 've covered up everything else . `` you took a taxi from the bus station , '' he said . `` probably paid with a twenty . got six , seven bucks in change . somebody expects to live under this roof , he ought to carry his own weight . am i right , eddie ? '' [ 31 ] eddie , the super of the apartment building , looked at me with a twinge of sympathy . `` come on . gabe , '' he said . `` the kid just got here . '' `` am i right ? '' gabe repeated . eddie scowled into his bowl of pretzels . the other two guys passed gas in harmony . `` fine , '' i said . i dug a wad of dollars out of my pocket and threw the money on the table . `` i hope you lose . '' `` your report card came , brain boy ! '' he shouted after me . `` i would n't act so snooty ! '' i slammed the door to my room , which really was n't my room . during school months , it was gabe 's `` study . '' he did n't study anything in there except old car magazines , but he loved shoving my stuff in the closet , leaving his muddy boots on my windowsill , and doing his best to make the place smell like his nasty cologne and cigars and stale beer . i dropped my suitcase on the bed . home sweet home . gabe 's smell was almost worse than the nightmares about mrs. dodds , or the sound of that old fruit lady 's shears snipping the yarn . but as soon as i thought that , my legs felt weak . i remembered grover 's look of panic — how he 'd made me promise i would n't go home without him . a sudden chill rolled through me . i felt like someone — something — was looking for me right now , maybe pounding its way up the stairs , growing long , horrible talons . then i heard my mom 's voice . `` percy ? '' she opened the bedroom door , and my fears melted . my mother can make me feel good just by walking into [ 32 ] the room . her eyes sparkle and change color in the light . her smile is as warm as a quilt . she 's got a few gray streaks mixed in with her long brown hair , but i never think of her as old . when she looks at me , it 's like she 's seeing all the good things about me , none of the bad . i 've never heard her raise her voice or say an unkind word to anyone , not even me or gabe . `` oh , percy . '' she hugged me tight . `` i ca n't believe it . you 've grown since christmas ! '' her red-white -and-blue sweet on america uniform smelled like the best things in the world : chocolate , licorice , and all the other stuff she sold at the candy shop in grand central . she 'd brought me a huge bag of `` free samples , '' the way she always did when i came home . we sat together on the edge of the bed . while i attacked the blueberry sour strings , she ran her hand through my hair and demanded to know everything i had n't put in my letters . she did n't mention anything about my getting expelled . she did n't seem to care about that . but was i okay ? was her little boy doing all right ? i told her she was smothering me , and to lay off and all that , but secretly , i was really , really glad to see her . from the other room , gabe yelled , `` hey , sally — how about some bean dip , huh ? '' i gritted my teeth . my mom is the nicest lady in the world . she should 've been married to a millionaire , not to some jerk like gabe . for her sake , i tried to sound upbeat about my last days at yancy academy . i told her i was n't too down about the expulsion . i 'd lasted almost the whole year this time . i 'd [ 33 ] made some new friends . id done pretty well in latin . and honestly , the fights had n't been as bad as the headmaster said . i liked yancy academy . i really did . i put such a good spin on the year . i almost convinced myself . i started chok- ing up , thinking about grover and mr. brunner . even nancy bobofit suddenly did n't seem so bad . until that trip to the museum . . . `` what ? '' my mom asked . her eyes tugged at my con- science , trying to pull out the secrets . `` did something scare you ? `` no , mom . '' i felt bad lying . i wanted to tell her about mrs. dodds and the three old ladies with the yarn , but i thought it would sound stupid . she pursed her lips . she knew i was holding back , but she did n't push me . `` i have a surprise for you , '' she said . `` we 're going to the beach. `` my eyes widened . `` montauk ? '' `` three nights — same cabin . '' `` when ? '' she smiled . `` as soon as i get changed . '' i could n't believe it . my mom and i had n't been to montauk the last two summers , because gabe said there was n't enough money . gabe appeared in the doorway and growled , `` bean dip , sally ? did n't you hear me ? '' i wanted to punch him , but i met my mom 's eyes and i understood she was offering me a deal : be nice to gabe for [ 34 ] a little while . just until she was ready to leave for montauk . then we would get out of here . `` i was on my way , honey , '' she told gabe . `` we were just talking about the trip . '' gabe 's eyes got small . `` the trip ? you mean you were serious about that ? '' `` i knew it , '' i muttered . `` he wo n't let us go . '' `` of course he will , '' my mom said evenly . `` your step- father is just worried about money . that 's all . besides , '' she added , `` gabriel wo n't have to settle for bean dip . i 'll make him enough seven-layer dip for the whole weekend . guacamole . sour cream . the works . '' gabe softened a bit . `` so this money for your trip ... it comes out of your clothes budget , right ? '' `` yes , honey , '' my mother said . `` and you wo n't take my car anywhere but there and back . '' `` we 'll be very careful . '' gabe scratched his double chin . `` maybe if you hurry with that seven-layer dip . . . and maybe if the kid apolo- gizes for interrupting my poker game . '' maybe if i kick you in your soft spot , i thought . and make you sing soprano for a week . but my mom 's eyes warned me not to make him mad . why did she put up with this guy ? i wanted to scream . why did she care what he thought ? `` i 'm sorry , '' i muttered . `` i 'm really sorry i interrupted your incredibly important poker game . please go back to it right now . '' [ 35 ] gabe 's eyes narrowed . his tiny brain was probably try- ing to detect sarcasm in my statement . `` yeah , whatever , '' he decided . he went back to his game . `` thank you , percy , '' my mom said . `` once we get to montauk , we 'll talk more about . . . whatever you 've forgot- ten to tell me , okay ? '' for a moment , 1 thought i saw anxiety in her eyes — the same fear i 'd seen in grover during the bus ride — as if my mom too felt an odd chill in the air . but then her smile returned , and i figured i must have been mistaken . she ruffled my hair and went to make gabe his seven-layer dip . an hour later we were ready to leave . gabe took a break from his poker game long enough to watch me lug my mom 's bags to the car . he kept griping and groaning about losing her cooking — and more impor- tant , his '78 carnaro — for the whole weekend . `` not a scratch on this car , brain boy , '' he warned me as i loaded the last bag . `` not one little scratch . '' like i 'd be the one driving . i was twelve . but that did n't matter to gabe . if a seagull so much as pooped on his paint job , he 'd find a way to blame me . watching him lumber back toward the apartment build- ing , i got so mad i did something i ca n't explain . as gabe reached the doorway , i made the hand gesture i 'd seen grover make on the bus , a sort of warding-off-evil gesture , a clawed hand over my heart , then a shoving movement [ 36 ] toward gabe . the screen door slammed shut so hard it whacked him in the butt and sent him flying up the stair- case as if he 'd been shot from a cannon . maybe it was just the wind , or some freak accident with the hinges , but i did n't stay long enough to find out . i got in the camaro and told my mom to step on it . our rental cabin was on the south shore , way out at the tip of long island . it was a little pastel box with faded cur- tains , half sunken into the dunes . there was always sand in the sheets and spiders in the cabinets , and most of the time the sea was too cold to swim in . i loved the place . we 'd been going there since i was a baby . my mom had been going even longer . she never exactly said , but i knew why the beach was special to her . it was the place where she 'd met my dad . as we got closer to montauk , she seemed to grow younger , years of worry and work disappearing from her face . her eyes turned the color of the sea . we got there at sunset , opened all the cabin 's windows , and went through our usual cleaning routine . we walked on the beach , fed blue corn chips to the seagulls , and munched on blue jelly beans , blue saltwater taffy , and all the other free samples my mom had brought from work . i guess i should explain the blue food . see , gabe had once told my mom there was no such thing . they had this fight , which seemed like a really small thing at the time . but ever since , my mom went out of her [ 37 ] way to eat blue . she baked blue birthday cakes . she mixed blueberry smoothies . she bought blue-corn tortilla chips and brought home blue candy from the shop . this — along with keeping her maiden name , jackson , rather than call- ing herself mrs. ugliano — was proof that she was n't totally suckered by gabe . she did have a rebellious streak , like me . when it got dark , we made a fire . we roasted hot dogs and marshmallows . mom told me stories about when she was a kid , back before her parents died in the plane crash . she told me about the books she wanted to write someday , when she had enough money to quit the candy shop . eventually , i got up the nerve to ask about what was always on my mind whenever we came to montauk — my father . mom 's eyes went all misty . i figured she would tell me the same things she always did , but i never got tired of hearing them . `` he was kind , percy , '' she said . `` tall , handsome , and powerful . but gentle , too . you have his black hair , you know , and his green eyes . '' mom fished a blue jelly bean out of her candy bag . `` i wish he could see you , percy . he would be so proud . '' i wondered how she could say that . what was so great about me ? a dyslexic , hyperactive boy with a d+ report card , kicked out of school for the sixth time in six years . `` how old was i ? '' i asked . `` i mean . . . when he left ? '' she watched the flames . `` he was only with me for one summer , percy . right here at this beach . this cabin . '' `` but ... he knew me as a baby . '' [ 38 ] '' no , honey . he knew i was expecting a baby , but he never saw you . he had to leave before you were born . '' i tried to square that with the fact that i seemed to remember . . . something about my father . a warm glow . a smile . i had always assumed he knew me as a baby . my mom had never said it outright , but still . id felt it must be true . now , to be told that he 'd never even seen me . . . i felt angry at my father . maybe it was stupid , but i resented him for going on that ocean voyage , for not having the guts to marry my mom . he 'd left us , and now we were stuck with smelly gabe . `` are you going to send me away again ? '' i asked her . `` to another boarding school ? '' she pulled a marshmallow from the fire . `` i do n't know , honey . '' her voice was heavy . `` i think . . . i think we 'll have to do something . '' `` because you do n't want me around ? '' i regretted the words as soon as they were out . my mom 's eyes welled with tears . she took my hand , squeezed it tight . `` oh , percy , no . i — i have to , honey . for your own good . i have to send you away . '' her words reminded me of what mr. brunner had said — that it was best for me to leave yancy . `` because i 'm not normal , '' i said . `` you say that as if it 's a bad thing , percy . but you do n't realize how important you are . i thought yancy academy would be far enough away . i thought you 'd finally be safe . '' `` safe from what ? '' [ 39 ] she met my eyes , and a flood of memories came back to me — all the weird , scary things that had ever happened to me , some of which id tried to forget . during third grade , a man in a black trench coat had stalked me on the playground . when the teachers threatened to call the police , he went away growling , but no one believed me when i told them that under his broad-brimmed hat , the man only had one eye , right in the middle of his head . before that — a really early memory . i was in preschool , and a teacher accidentally put me down for a nap in a cot that a snake had slithered into . my mom screamed when she came to pick me up and found me playing with a limp , scaly rope id somehow managed to strangle to death with my meaty toddler hands . in every single school , something creepy had happened , something unsafe , and i was forced to move . i knew i should tell my mom about the old ladies at the fruit stand , and mrs. dodds at the art museum , about my weird hallucination that i had sliced my math teacher into dust with a sword . but i could n't make myself tell her . i had a strange feeling the news would end our trip to montauk , and i did n't want that . `` i 've tried to keep you as close to me as i could . '' my mom said . `` they told me that was a mistake . but there 's only one other option . percy — the place your father wanted to send you . and i just ... i just ca n't stand to do it . '' `` my father wanted me to go to a special school ? '' `` not a school , '' she said softly . `` a summer camp . '' my head was spinning . why would my dad — who [ 40 ] had n't even stayed around long enough to see me born — talk to my mom about a summer camp ? and if it was so important , why had n't she ever mentioned it before ? `` i 'm sorry , percy , '' she said , seeing the look in my eyes . `` but i ca n't talk about it . i — i could n't send you to that place . it might mean saying good-bye to you for good . '' `` for good ? but if it 's only a summer camp . . . '' she turned toward the fire , and i knew from her expres- sion that if i asked her any more questions she would start to cry . that night i had a vivid dream . it was storming on the beach , and two beautiful ani- mals , a white horse and a golden eagle , were trying to kill each other at the edge of the surf . the eagle swooped down and slashed the horse 's muzzle with its huge talons . the horse reared up and kicked at the eagle 's wings . as they fought , the ground rumbled , and a monstrous voice chuck- led somewhere beneath the earth , goading the animals to fight harder . i ran toward them , knowing i had to stop them from killing each other , but i was running in slow motion . i knew i would be too late . i saw the eagle dive down , its beak aimed at the horse 's wide eyes , and i screamed . no ! i woke with a start . outside , it really was storming , the kind of storm that cracks trees and blows down houses . there was no horse or eagle on the beach , just lightning making false daylight , and twenty-foot waves pounding the dunes like artillery . [ 41 ] with the next thunderclap , my mom woke . she sat up , eyes wide , and said , `` hurricane . '' i knew that was crazy . long island never sees hurricanes this early in the summer . but the ocean seemed to have for- gotten . over the roar of the wind . i heard a distant bellow , an angry , tortured sound that made my hair stand on end . then a much closer noise , like mallets in the sand . a desperate voice — someone yelling , pounding on our cabin door . my mother sprang out of bed in her nightgown and threw open the lock . grover stood framed in the doorway against a backdrop of pouring rain . but he was n't ... he was n't exactly grover . `` searching all night , '' he gasped . `` what were you thinking ? '' my mother looked at me in terror — not scared of grover , but of why he 'd come . `` percy , '' she said , shouting to be heard over the rain . `` what happened at school ? what did n't you tell me ? '' i was frozen , looking at grover . i could n't understand what i was seeing . `` o zeu kai allot theoi ! '' he yelled . `` it 's right behind me ! did n't you tell her ? '' i was too shocked to register that he 'd just cursed in ancient greek , and i 'd understood him perfectly . i was too shocked to wonder how grover had gotten here by himself in the middle of the night . because grover did n't have his pants on — and where his legs should be . . . where his legs should be . . . [ 42 ] my mom looked at me sternly and talked in a tone shed never used before : `` percy . tell me now ! '' i stammered something about the old ladies at the fruit stand , and mrs. dodds , and my mom stared at me . her face deathly pale in the flashes of lightning . she grabbed her purse , tossed me my rain jacket , and said , `` get to the car . both of you . go ! '' grover ran for the carnaro — but he was n't running , exactly . he was trotting , shaking his shaggy hindquarters , and suddenly his story about a muscular disorder in his legs made sense to me . i understood how he could run so fast and still limp when he walked . because where his feet should be , there were no feet . there were cloven hooves . [ 43 ] 4 t my moth€r t€ach es m€ bullfi^htinq we tore through the night along dark country roads . wind slammed against the camaro . rain lashed the wind- shield . i did n't know how my mom could see anything , but she kept her foot on the gas . every time there was a flash of lightning , i looked at grover sitting next to me in the backseat and i won- dered if i 'd gone insane , or if he was wearing some kind of shag-carpet pants . but , no , the smell was one i remem- bered from kindergarten field trips to the petting zoo — lanolin , like from wool . the smell of a wet barnyard animal . all i could think to say was , `` so , you and my mom . . . know each other ? '' grover 's eyes flitted to the rearview mirror , though there were no cars behind us . `` not exactly , '' he said . `` i mean , we 've never met in person . but she knew i was watching you . `` watching me ? '' `` keeping tabs on you . making sure you were okay . but i was n't faking being your friend , '' he added hastily . `` i am your friend . '' `` um . . . what are you , exactly ? '' `` that does n't matter right now . '' `` it does n't matter ? from the waist down , my best friend is a donkey — `` grover let out a sharp , throaty `` blaa~ha~ha ! '' i 'd heard him make that sound before , but i 'd always assumed it was a nervous laugh . now i realized it was more of an irritated bleat . `` goat ! '' he cried . `` what ? '' `` i 'm a goat from the waist down . '' `` you just said it did n't matter . '' `` blaa~ha~ha ! there are satyrs who would trample you underhoof for such an insult ! '' `` whoa . wait . satyrs . you mean like . . . mr. brunner 's myths ? '' `` were those old ladies at the fruit stand a myth , percy ? was mrs. dodds a myth ? '' `` so you admit there was a mrs . dodds ! '' `` of course . '' `` then why — `` '' the less you knew , the fewer monsters you 'd attract , '' grover said , like that should be perfectly obvious . `` we put mist over the humans ' eyes . we hoped you 'd think the kindly one was a hallucination . but it was no good . you started to realize who you are . '' `` who i — wait a minute , what do you mean ? '' the weird bellowing noise rose up again somewhere behind us , closer than before . whatever was chasing us was still on our trail . 145 ] '' percy , '' my mom said , `` there 's too much to explain and not enough time . we have to get you to safety . '' `` safety from what ? who 's after me ? '' `` oh , nobody much , '' grover said , obviously still miffed about the donkey comment . `` just the lord of the dead and a few of his blood-thirstiest minions . '' `` grover ! `` `` sorry , mrs. jackson . could you drive faster , please ? '' i tried to wrap my mind around what was happening , but i could n't do it . i knew this was n't a dream . i had no imagination . i could never dream up something this weird . my mom made a hard left . we swerved onto a narrower road , racing past darkened farmhouses and wooded hills and pick your own strawberries signs on white picket fences . `` where are we going ? '' i asked . `` the summer camp i told you about . '' my mother 's voice was tight ; she was trying for my sake not to be scared . `` the place your father wanted to send you . '' `` the place you did n't want me to go . '' `` please , dear , '' my mother begged . `` this is hard enough . try to understand . you 're in danger . '' `` because some old ladies cut yarn . '' `` those were n't old ladies , '' grover said . `` those were the fates . do you know what it means — the fact they appeared in front of you ? they only do that when you 're about to . . . when someone 's about to die . '' `` whoa . you said 'you . ' '' `` no i did n't . i said 'someone . ' '' 146 ] '' you meant 'you . ' as in me ! ' `` i m ea n t you , like 'someone . ' not you , you. `` `` boys ! '' my mom said . she pulled the wheel hard to the right , and i got a glimpse of a figure she 'd swerved to avoid — a dark flutter- ing shape now lost behind us in the storm . `` what was that ? '' i asked . `` we 're almost there , '' my mother said , ignoring my question . `` another mile . please . please . please . '' i did n't know where there was , but i found myself lean- ing forward in the car , anticipating , wanting us to arrive . outside , nothing but rain and darkness — the kind of empty countryside you get way out on the tip of long island . i thought about mrs. dodds and the moment when she 'd changed into the thing with pointed teeth and leath- ery wings . my limbs went numb from delayed shock . she really had n't been human . she 'd meant to kill me . then i thought about mr. brunner . . . and the sword he had thrown me . before i could ask grover about that , the hair rose on the back of my neck . there was a blinding flash , a jaw-rattling boom ! , and our car exploded . i remember feeling weightless , like i was being crushed , fried , and hosed down all at the same time . i peeled my forehead off the back of the driver 's seat and said , `` ow . '' `` percy ! '' my mom shouted. '' i ' m okay . ... '' i tried to shake off the daze . i was n't dead . the car had n't really exploded . wed swerved into a ditch . our [ 47 ] driver's-side doors were wedged in the mud . the roof had cracked open like an eggshell and rain was pouring in . lightning . that was the only explanation . wed been blasted right off the road . next to me in the backseat was a big motionless lump . `` grover ! '' he was slumped over , blood trickling from the side of his mouth . i shook his furry hip , thinking , no ! even if you are half barnyard animal , you 're my best friend and i do n't want you to die ! then he groaned `` food , '' and i knew there was hope . `` percy , '' my mother said , `` we have to . . her voice faltered . i looked back . in a flash of lightning , through the mud- spattered rear windshield , i saw a figure lumbering toward us on the shoulder of the road . the sight of it made my skin crawl . it was a dark silhouette of a huge guy , like a football player . he seemed to be holding a blanket over his head . his top half was bulky and fuzzy . his upraised hands made it look like he had horns . i swallowed hard . `` who is — `` '' percy , '' my mother said , deadly serious . `` get out of the car . '' my mother threw herself against the drivers-side door . it was jammed shut in the mud . i tried mine . stuck too . i looked up desperately at the hole in the roof . it might 've been an exit , but the edges were sizzling and smoking . `` climb out the passenger 's side ! '' my mother told me . `` percy — you have to run . do you see that big tree ? '' `` what ? '' [ 48 ] another flash of lightning , and through the smoking hole in the roof i saw the tree she meant : a huge . white house christmas tree — sized pine at the crest of the nearest hill . `` that 's the property line , '' my mom said . `` get over that hill and you 'll see a big farmhouse down in the valley . run and do n't look back . yell for help . do n't stop until you reach the door . '' `` mom , you 're coming too . '' her face was pale , her eyes as sad as when she looked at the ocean . `` no ! '' i shouted . `` you are coming with me . help me carry grover . '' `` food ! '' grover moaned , a little louder . the man with the blanket on his head kept coming toward us , making his grunting , snorting noises . as he got closer . i realized he could n't be holding a blanket over his head , because his hands — huge meaty hands — were swing- ing at his sides . there was no blanket . meaning the bulky , fuzzy mass that was too big to be his head . . . was his head . and the points that looked like horns . . . `` he does n't want us '' my mother told me . `` he wants you . besides , i ca n't cross the property line . '' `` but . . . '' `` we do n't have time , percy . go . please . '' i got mad , then — mad at my mother , at grover the goat , at the thing with horns that was lumbering toward us slowly and deliberately like , like a bull . i climbed across grover and pushed the door open into the rain . `` we 're going together . come on , mom . '' [ 49 ] '' i told you — `` '' mom ! i am not leaving you . help me with grover . '' i did n't wait for her answer . i scrambled outside , drag- ging grover from the car . he was surprisingly light , but i could n't have carried him very far if my mom had n't come to my aid . together , we draped grover 's arms over our shoulders and started stumbling uphill through wet waist-high grass . glancing back , i got my first clear look at the monster . he was seven feet tall , easy , his arms and legs like something from the cover of muscle man magazine — bulging biceps and triceps and a bunch of other 'ceps , all stuffed like baseballs under vein-webbed skin . he wore no clothes except under- wear — i mean , bright white fruit of the looms — which would 've looked funny , except that the top half of his body was so scary . coarse brown hair started at about his belly button and got thicker as it reached his shoulders . his neck was a mass of muscle and fur leading up to his enormous head , which had a snout as long as my arm , snotty nostrils with a gleaming brass ring , cruel black eyes , and horns — enormous black-and-white horns with points you just could n't get from an electric sharpener . i recognized the monster , all right . he had been in one of the first stories mr. brunner told us . but he could n't be real . i blinked the rain out of my eyes . `` that 's — `` '' pasiphae 's son , '' my mother said . `` i wish i 'd known how badly they want to kill you . '' `` but he 's the min — `` [ 50 ] '' do n't say his name , '' she warned . `` names have power . '' the pine tree was still way too far — a hundred yards uphill at least . i glanced behind me again . the bull-man hunched over our car , looking in the win- dows — or not looking , exactly . more like snuffling , nuz- zling . i was n't sure why he bothered , since we were only about fifty feet away . `` food ? '' grover moaned . `` shhh , '' i told him . `` mom , what 's he doing ? does n't he see us ? `` his sight and hearing are terrible . '' she said . `` he goes by smell . but he 'll figure out where we are soon enough. ” as if on cue , the bull-man bellowed in rage . he picked up gabe 's camaro by the torn roof , the chassis creaking and groaning . he raised the car over his head and threw it down the road . it slammed into the wet asphalt and skidded in a shower of sparks for about half a mile before coming to a stop . the gas tank exploded . not a scratch , i remembered gabe saying . oops . `` percy , '' my mom said . `` when he sees us , he 'll charge . wait until the last second , then jump out of the way — directly sideways . he ca n't change directions very well once he 's charging . do you understand ? '' `` how do you know all this ? '' `` i 've been worried about an attack for a long time . i should have expected this . i was selfish , keeping you near me . '' [ 51 ] '' keeping me near you ? but — `` another bellow of rage , and the bull-man started tromping uphill . he 'd smelled us . the pine tree was only a few more yards , but the hill was getting steeper and slicker , and grover was n't getting any lighter . the bull-man closed in . another few seconds and he 'd be on top of us . my mother must 've been exhausted , but she shouldered grover . `` go , percy ! separate ! remember what i said . '' i did n't want to split up , but i had the feeling she was right — it was our only chance . i sprinted to the left , turned , and saw the creature bearing down on me . his black eyes glowed with hate . he reeked like rotten meat . he lowered his head and charged , those razor-sharp horns aimed straight at my chest . the fear in my stomach made me want to bolt , but that would n't work . i could never outrun this thing . so i held my ground , and at the last moment , i jumped to the side . the bull-man stormed past like a freight train , then bel- lowed with frustration and turned , but not toward me this time , toward my mother , who was setting grover down in the grass . wed reached the crest of the hill . down the other side i could see a valley , just as my mother had said , and the lights of a farmhouse glowing yellow through the rain . but that was half a mile away . we 'd never make it . the bull -man grunted , pawing the ground . he kept [ 52 ] eyeing my mother , who was now retreating slowly downhill , back toward the road , trying to lead the monster away from grover . `` run , percy ! '' she told me . `` i ca n't go any farther . run ! '' but i just stood there , frozen in fear , as the monster charged her . she tried to sidestep , as she 'd told me to do , but the monster had learned his lesson . his hand shot out and grabbed her by the neck as she tried to get away . he lifted her as she struggled , kicking and pummeling the air . `` mom ! '' she caught my eyes , managed to choke out one last word : `` go ! '' then , with an angry roar , the monster closed his fists around my mother 's neck , and she dissolved before my eyes , melting into light , a shimmering golden form , as if she were a holographic projection . a blinding flash , and she was sim- ply . . . gone . `` no ! '' anger replaced my fear . newfound strength burned in my limbs — the same rush of energy i 'd gotten when mrs. dodds grew talons . the bull-man bore down on grover , who lay helpless in the grass . the monster hunched over , snuffling my best friend , as if he were about to lift grover up and make him dissolve too . i could n't allow that . i stripped off my red rain jacket . `` hey ! '' i screamed , waving the jacket , running to one side of the monster . `` hey , stupid ! ground beef ! '' [ s3 ] '' raaaarrrrr ! `` the monster turned toward me , shaking his meaty fists . i had an idea — a stupid idea , but better than no idea at all . i put my back to the big pine tree and waved my red jacket in front of the bull-man , thinking id jump out of the way at the last moment . but it did n't happen like that . the bull-man charged too fast , his arms out to grab me whichever way i tried to dodge . time slowed down . my legs tensed . i could n't jump sideways , so i leaped straight up , kicking off from the creature 's head , using it as a springboard , turning in midair , and landing on his neck . how did i do that ? i did n't have time to figure it out . a millisecond later , the monster 's head slammed into the tree and the impact nearly knocked my teeth out . the bull-man staggered around , trying to shake me . i locked my arms around his horns to keep from being thrown . thunder and lightning were still going strong . the rain was in my eyes . the smell of rotten meat burned my nostrils . the monster shook himself around and bucked like a rodeo bull . he should have just backed up into the tree and smashed me flat , but i was starting to realize that this thing had only one gear : forward . meanwhile , grover started groaning in the grass . i wanted to yell at him to shut up . but the way i was getting tossed around , if i opened my mouth i 'd bite my own tongue off . [ 54 ] '' food ! '' grover moaned . the bull -man wheeled toward him , pawed the ground again , and got ready to charge . i thought about how he had squeezed the life out of my mother , made her disappear in a flash of light , and rage filled me like high-octane fuel . i got both hands around one horn and i pulled backward with all my might . the monster tensed , gave a surprised grunt , then — snap ! the bull-man screamed and flung me through the air . i landed flat on my back in the grass . my head smacked against a rock . when i sat up , my vision was blurry , but i had a horn in my hands , a ragged bone weapon the size of a knife . the monster charged . without thinking , i rolled to one side and came up kneeling . as the monster barreled past , i drove the broken horn straight into his side , right up under his furry rib cage . the bull-man roared in agony . he flailed , clawing at his chest , then began to disintegrate — not like my mother , in a flash of golden light , but like crumbling sand , blown away in chunks by the wind , the same way mrs. dodds had burst apart . the monster was gone . the rain had stopped . the storm still rumbled , but only in the distance . i smelled like livestock and my knees were shaking . my head felt like it was splitting open . i was weak and scared and trembling with grief . id just seen my mother vanish . i wanted to lie down and cry , but there was grover , needing my help , so i managed to haul him up and stagger down into the valley , toward the lights of the farm- house . i was crying , calling for my mother , but i held on to grover — i was n't going to let him go . the last thing i remember is collapsing on a wooden porch , looking up at a ceiling fan circling above me , moths flying around a yellow light , and the stern faces of a familiar-looking bearded man and a pretty girl , her blond hair curled like a princess 's . they both looked down at me , and the girl said , `` he 's the one . he must be . '' `` silence , annabeth , '' the man said . `` he 's still conscious . bring him inside . '' [ 56 ] i play pinochle with a hors6 i had weird dreams full of barnyard animals . most of them wanted to kill me . the rest wanted food . i must 've woken up several times , but what i heard and saw made no sense , so i just passed out again . i remember lying in a soft bed , being spoon-fed something that tasted like buttered popcorn , only it was pudding . the girl with curly blond hair hovered over me , smirking as she scraped drips off my chin with the spoon . when she saw my eyes open , she asked , `` what will happen at the summer solstice ? '' i managed to croak , `` what ? '' she looked around , as if afraid someone would over- hear . `` what 's going on ? what was stolen ? we 've only got a few weeks ! '' `` i 'm sorry , '' i mumbled , `` i do n't . . . '' somebody knocked on the door , and the girl quickly filled my mouth with pudding . the next time i woke up , the girl was gone . a husky blond dude , like a surfer , stood in the corner of the bedroom keeping watch over me . he had blue eyes — at least a dozen of them — on his cheeks , his forehead , the backs of his hands . [ 57 ] * * * when i finally came around for good , there was nothing weird about my surroundings , except that they were nicer than i was used to . i was sitting in a deck chair on a huge porch , gazing across a meadow at green hills in the distance . the breeze smelled like strawberries . there was a blanket over my legs , a pillow behind my neck . all that was great , but my mouth felt like a scorpion had been using it for a nest . my tongue was dry and nasty and every one of my teeth hurt . on the table next to me was a tall drink . it looked like iced apple juice , with a green straw and a paper parasol stuck through a maraschino cherry . my hand was so weak i almost dropped the glass once i got my fingers around it . `` careful , '' a familiar voice said . grover was leaning against the porch railing , looking like he had n't slept in a week . under one arm , he cradled a shoe box . he was wearing blue jeans . converse hi-tops and a bright orange t-shirt that said camp half-blood . just plain old grover . not the goat boy . so maybe i 'd had a nightmare . maybe my mom was okay . we were still on vacation , and we 'd stopped here at this big house for some reason . and . . . `` you saved my life , '' grover said . `` i . . . well , the least i could do ... i went back to the hill . i thought you might want this . '' reverently , he placed the shoe box in my lap . inside was a black-and-white bull 's horn , the base jagged [ 58 ] from being broken off , the tip splattered with dried blood . it had n't been a nightmare . `` the minotaur , '' i said . `` um , percy , it is n't a good idea — `` '' that 's what they call him in the greek myths , is n't it ? '' i demanded . `` the minotaur . half man , half bull . '' grover shifted uncomfortably . `` you 've been out for two days . how much do you remember ? '' `` my mom . is she really ... '' he looked down . i stared across the meadow . there were groves of trees , a winding stream , acres of strawberries spread out under the blue sky . the valley was surrounded by rolling hills , and the tallest one , directly in front of us , was the one with the huge pine tree on top . even that looked beautiful in the sunlight . my mother was gone . the whole world should be black and cold . nothing should look beautiful . `` i 'm sorry , '' grover sniffled . `` i 'm a failure . i 'm — i 'm the worst satyr in the world . '' he moaned , stomping his foot so hard it came off . i mean , the converse hi-top came off . the inside was filled with styrofoam , except for a hoof-shaped hole . `` oh , styx ! '' he mumbled . thunder rolled across the clear sky . as he struggled to get his hoof back in the fake foot , i thought . well , that settles it . grover was a satyr . i was ready to bet that if i shaved his curly brown hair , i 'd find tiny horns on his head . but i was too miserable to care that satyrs existed , or even minotaurs . [ 59 ] all that meant was my mom really had been squeezed into nothingness , dissolved into yellow light . i was alone . an orphan . i would have to live with . . . smelly gabe ? no . that would never happen . i would live on the streets first . i would pretend i was seventeen and join the army . id do something . grover was still sniffling . the poor kid — poor goat , satyr , whatever — looked as if he expected to be hit . i said , `` it was n't your fault . '' `` yes , it was . i was supposed to protect you . '' `` did my mother ask you to protect me ? '' `` no . but that 's my job . i 'm a keeper . at least ... i was . '' `` but why ... '' i suddenly felt dizzy , my vision swim- ming . `` do n't strain yourself , '' grover said . `` here . '' he helped me hold my glass and put the straw to my lips . i recoiled at the taste , because i was expecting apple juice . it was n't that at all . it was chocolate-chip cookies . liquid cookies . and not just any cookies — my mom 's homemade blue chocolate-chip cookies , buttery and hot , with the chips still melting . drinking it , my whole body felt warm and good , full of energy . my grief did n't go away , but i felt as if my mom had just brushed her hand against my cheek , given me a cookie the way she used to when i was small , and told me everything was going to be okay . before i knew it , i 'd drained the glass . i stared into it , sure i 'd just had a warm drink , but the ice cubes had n't even melted . [ 60 ] '' was it good ? '' grover asked . i nodded . `` what did it taste like ? '' he sounded so wistful , i felt guilty . `` sorry , '' i said . `` i should 've let you taste . '' his eyes got wide . `` no ! that 's not what i meant . i just . . . wondered . '' `` chocolate-chip cookies , '' i said . `` my mom 's . home- made . '' he sighed . `` and how do you feel ? '' `` like i could throw nancy bobofit a hundred yards . '' `` that 's good , '' he said . `` that 's good . i do n't think you could risk drinking any more of that stuff . '' `` what do you mean ? '' he took the empty glass from me gingerly , as if it were dynamite , and set it back on the table . `` come on . chiron and mr. d are waiting . '' the porch wrapped all the way around the farmhouse . my legs felt wobbly , trying to walk that far . grover offered to carry the minotaur horn , but i held on to it . i 'd paid for that souvenir the hard way . i was n't going to let it go . as we came around the opposite end of the house , i caught my breath . we must 've been on the north shore of long island , because on this side of the house , the valley marched all the way up to the water , which glittered about a mile in the dis- tance . between here and there . i simply could n't process everything i was seeing . the landscape was dotted with [ 61 ] buildings that looked like ancient greek architecture — an open-air pavilion , an amphitheater , a circular arena — except that they all looked brand new , their white marble columns sparkling in the sun . in a nearby sandpit , a dozen high school — age kids and satyrs played volleyball . canoes glided across a small lake . kids in bright orange t-shirts like grover 's were chasing each other around a cluster of cabins nestled in the woods . some shot targets at an archery range . others rode horses down a wooded trail , and , unless i was hallucinating , some of their horses had wings . down at the end of the porch , two men sat across from each other at a card table . the blond-haired girl who 'd spoon-fed me popcorn-flavored pudding was leaning on the porch rail next to them . the man facing me was small , but porky . he had a red nose , big watery eyes , and curly hair so black it was almost purple . he looked like those paintings of baby angels — what do you call them , hubbubs ? no , cherubs . that 's it . he looked like a cherub who 'd turned middle-aged in a trailer park . he wore a tiger-pattern hawaiian shirt , and he would 've fit right in at one of gabe 's poker parties , except i got the feeling this guy could 've out-gambled even my step- father . `` that 's mr. d , '' grover murmured to me . `` he 's the camp director . be polite . the girl , that 's annabeth chase . she 's just a camper , but she 's been here longer than just about anybody . and you already know chiron . . . . '' he pointed at the guy whose back was to me . first , i realized he was sitting in the wheelchair . then i [ 62 ] recognized the tweed jacket , the thinning brown hair , the scraggly beard . `` mr . brunner ! '' i cried . the latin teacher turned and smiled at me . his eyes had that mischievous glint they sometimes got in class when he pulled a pop quiz and made all the multiple choice answers b . `` ah , good , percy , '' he said . `` now we have four for pinochle . '' he offered me a chair to the right of mr. d , who looked at me with bloodshot eyes and heaved a great sigh . `` oh , i suppose i must say it . welcome to camp half- blood . there . now . do n't expect me to be glad to see you . '' `` uh , thanks . '' i scooted a little farther away from him because , if there was one thing i had learned from living with gabe , it was how to tell when an adult has been hit- ting the happy juice . if mr. d was a stranger to alcohol , i was a satyr . `` annabeth ? '' mr. brunner called to the blond girl . she came forward and mr. brunner introduced us . `` this young lady nursed you back to health , percy . annabeth , my dear , why do n't you go check on percy 's bunk ? we 'll be putting him in cabin eleven for now . '' annabeth said , `` sure , chiron . '' she was probably my age , maybe a couple of inches taller , and a whole lot more athletic looking . with her deep tan and her curly blond hair , she was almost exactly what i thought a stereotypical california girl would look like , except her eyes ruined the image . they were startling 163 ] gray , like storm clouds ; pretty , but intimidating , too , as if she were analyzing the best way to take me down in a fight . she glanced at the minotaur horn in my hands , then back at me . i imagined she was going to say , you killed a mino- taur ! or wow , you 're so awesome ! or something like that . instead she said , `` you drool when you sleep . '' then she sprinted off down the lawn , her blond hair flying behind her . `` so , '' i said , anxious to change the subject . `` you , uh , work here , mr . brunner ? '' `` not mr. brunner , '' the ex — mr. brunner said . `` i 'm afraid that was a pseudonym . you may call me chiron . '' `` okay . '' totally confused , i looked at the director . `` and mr. d . . . does that stand for something ? '' mr. d stopped shuffling the cards . he looked at me like i 'd just belched loudly . `` young man , names are power- ful things . you do n't just go around using them for no reason. `` `` oh . right . sorry . '' `` i must say , percy , '' chiron-brunner broke in , `` i 'm glad to see you alive . it 's been a long time since i 've made a house call to a potential camper . i 'd hate to think i 've wasted my time . '' `` house call ? '' `` my year at yancy academy , to instruct you . we have satyrs at most schools , of course , keeping a lookout . but grover alerted me as soon as he met you . he sensed you were something special , so i decided to come upstate . i [ 64 ] convinced the other latin teacher to . . . ah , take a leave of absence . '' i tried to remember the beginning of the school year . it seemed like so long ago , but i did have a fuzzy memory of there being another latin teacher my first week at yancy . then , without explanation , he had disappeared and mr. brunner had taken the class . `` you came to yancy just to teach me ? '' i asked . chiron nodded . `` honestly , i was n't sure about you at first . we contacted your mother , let her know we were keeping an eye on you in case you were ready for camp half-blood . but you still had so much to learn . nevertheless , you made it here alive , and that 's always the first test . '' `` grover , '' mr. d said impatiently , `` are you playing or not ? '' `` yes , sir ! '' grover trembled as he took the fourth chair , though i did n't know why he should be so afraid of a pudgy little man in a tiger-print hawaiian shirt . `` you do know how to play pinochle ? '' mr. d eyed me suspiciously . `` i 'm afraid not , '' i said . `` i 'm afraid not , sir '' he said . `` sir , '' i repeated . i was liking the camp director less and less . `` well , '' he told me , `` it is , along with gladiator fighting and pac-man , one of the greatest games ever invented by humans . i would expect all civilized young men to know the rules . [ 65 ] '' i 'm sure the boy can learn , '' chiron said . `` please , '' i said , `` what is this place ? what am i doing here ? mr. brun — chiron — why would you go to yancy academy just to teach me ? '' mr. d snorted . `` i asked the same question . '' the camp director dealt the cards . grover flinched every time one landed in his pile . chiron smiled at me sympathetically , the way he used to in latin class , as if to let me know that no matter what my average was , l was his star student . he expected me to have the right answer . `` percy , '' he said . `` did your mother tell you nothing ? '' `` she said ... '' 1 remembered her sad eyes , looking out over the sea . `` she told me she was afraid to send me here , even though my father had wanted her to . she said that once i was here , i probably could n't leave . she wanted to keep me close to her . '' `` typical , '' mr. d said . `` that 's how they usually get killed . young man , are you bidding or not ? '' `` what ? '' i asked . he explained , impatiently , how you bid in pinochle , and so i did . `` i 'm afraid there 's too much to tell , '' chiron said . `` i 'm afraid our usual orientation film wo n't be sufficient . '' `` orientation film ? '' i asked . `` no , '' chiron decided . `` well . percy . you know your friend grover is a satyr . you know '' — he pointed to the horn in the shoe box — `` that you have killed the minotaur . no small feat , either , lad . what you may not know is that [ 66 ] great powers are at work in your life . gods — the forces you can the greek gods — are very much alive . '' i stared at the others around the table . i waited for somebody to yell . not ! but all i got was mr. d yelling , `` oh , a royal marriage . trick ! trick ! '' he cackled as he tallied up his points . `` mr. d , '' grover asked timidly , `` if you 're not going to eat it , could i have your diet coke can ? '' `` eh ? oh , all right . '' grover bit a huge shard out of the empty aluminum can and chewed it mournfully . `` wait , '' i told chiron . `` you 're telling me there 's such a thing as god . '' `` well , now , '' chiron said . `` god — capital g , god . that 's a different matter altogether . we sha n't deal with the metaphysical . '' `` metaphysical ? but you were just talking about — `` '' ah , gods , plural , as in , great beings that control the forces of nature and human endeavors : the immortal gods of olympus . that 's a smaller matter . '' `` smaller ? '' `` yes , quite . the gods we discussed in latin class . '' `` zeus , '' i said . `` hera . apollo . you mean them . '' and there it was again — distant thunder on a cloud- less day . `` young man , '' said mr. d , `` i would really be less casual about throwing those names around , if i were you . `` but they 're stories , '' i said . `` they 're — myths , to explain [ 67 ] lightning and the seasons and stuff . they 're what people believed before there was science . '' `` science ! '' mr. d scoffed . `` and tell me , perseus jackson '' — i flinched when he said my real name , which i never told anybody — `` what will people think of your 'sci- ence ' two thousand years from now ? '' mr. d continued . `` hmm ? they will call it primitive murnbo jumbo . that 's what . oh , i love mortals — they have absolutely no sense of perspective . they think they 've come 50-0-0 far . and have they , chiron ? look at this boy and tell me . '' i was n't liking mr. d much , but there was something about the way he called me mortal , as if . . . he was n't . it was enough to put a lump in my throat , to suggest why grover was dutifully minding his cards , chewing his soda can , and keeping his mouth shut . `` percy , '' chiron said , `` you may choose to believe or not , but the fact is that immortal means immortal . can you imag- ine that for a moment , never dying ? never fading ? existing , just as you are , for all time ? '' i was about to answer , off the top of my head , that it sounded like a pretty good deal , but the tone of chiron 's voice made me hesitate . `` you mean , whether people believed in you or not , '' i said . `` exactly , '' chiron agreed . `` if you were a god , how would you like being called a myth , an old story to explain lightning ? what if i told you , perseus jackson , that some- day people would call you a myth , just created to explain how little boys can get over losing their mothers ? '' [ 68 ] my heart pounded . he was trying to make me angry for some reason , but i was n't going to let him . i said . `` i would n't like it . but i do n't believe in gods . '' `` oh , you 'd better , '' mr. d murmured . `` before one of them incinerates you . '' grover said , `` p-please , sir . he 's just lost his mother . he 's in shock . '' `` a lucky thing , too , '' mr. d grumbled , playing a card . `` bad enough i 'm confined to this miserable job , working with boys who do n't even believe ! '' he waved his hand and a goblet appeared on the table , as if the sunlight had bent , momentarily , and woven the air into glass . the goblet filled itself with red wine . my jaw dropped , but chiron hardly looked up . `` mr. d , '' he warned , `` your restrictions . '' mr. d looked at the wine and feigned surprise . `` dear me . '' he looked at the sky and yelled , `` old habits ! sorry ! '' more thunder . mr. d waved his hand again , and the wineglass changed into a fresh can of diet coke . he sighed unhappily , popped the top of the soda , and went back to his card game . chiron winked at me . `` mr. d offended his father a while back , took a fancy to a wood nymph who had been declared off-limits . '' `` a wood nymph , '' i repeated , still staring at the diet coke can like it was from outer space . `` yes , '' mr. d confessed . `` father loves to punish me . the first time . prohibition . ghastly ! absolutely horrid ten [ 69 ] years ! the second time — well , she really was pretty , and i could n't stay away — the second time , he sent me here . half- blood hill . summer camp for brats like you . 'be a better influence . ' he told me . 'work with youths rather than tear- ing them down . ' ha ! absolutely unfair . '' mr. d sounded about six years old , like a pouting little kid . `` and ... '' i stammered , `` your father is . . . '' `` di immortelles , chiron . '' mr. d said . `` i thought you taught this boy the basics . my father is zeus , of course . '' i ran through d names from greek mythology . wine . the skin of a tiger . the satyrs that all seemed to work here . the way grover cringed , as if mr. d were his master . `` you 're dionysus , '' i said . `` the god of wine . '' mr. d rolled his eyes . `` what do they say , these days , grover ? do the children say , 'well , duh ! ' ? '' `` y-yes , mr. d. '' '' then , well , duh ! percy jackson . did you think i was aphrodite , perhaps ? '' `` you 're a god . '' `` yes , child . '' `` a god . you. `` he turned to look at me straight on , and i saw a kind of purplish fire in his eyes , a hint that this whiny , plump lit- tle man was only showing me the tiniest bit of his true nature . i saw visions of grape vines choking unbelievers to death , drunken warriors insane with battle lust , sailors screaming as their hands turned to flippers , their faces elon- gating into dolphin snouts . i knew that if i pushed him , [ vo ] mr. d would show me worse things . he would plant a disease in my brain that would leave me wearing a strait- jacket in a rubber room for the rest of my life . `` would you like to test me , child ? '' he said quietly . `` no . no , sir . '' the fire died a little . he turned back to his card game . `` i believe i win . '' `` not quite , mr. d , '' chiron said . he set down a straight , tallied the points , and said , `` the game goes to me. `` i thought mr. d was going to vaporize chiron right out of his wheelchair , but he just sighed through his nose , as if he were used to being beaten by the latin teacher . he got up , and grover rose , too . `` i 'm tired , '' mr. d said . `` i believe i 'll take a nap before the sing-along tonight . but first , grover , we need to talk , again , about your less-than-perfect performance on this assignment. `` grover 's face beaded with sweat . `` y-yes , sir . '' mr. d turned to me . `` cabin eleven , percy jackson . and mind your manners . '' he swept into the farmhouse , grover following miser- ably . `` will grover be okay ? '' i asked chiron . chiron nodded , though he looked a bit troubled . `` old dionysus is n't really mad . he just hates his job . he 's been . . . ah , grounded , i guess you would say , and he ca n't stand waiting another century before he 's allowed to go back to olympus . `` [ 71 ] '' mount olympus , '' i said . `` you 're telling me there really is a palace there ? '' `` well now , there 's mount olympus in greece . and then there 's the home of the gods , the convergence point of their powers , which did indeed used to be on mount olympus . it 's still called mount olympus , out of respect to the old ways , but the palace moves , percy , just as the gods do . '' `` you mean the greek gods are here ? like ... in america ! '' `` well , certainly . the gods move with the heart of the west. `` `` the what ? '' `` come now , percy . what you call 'western civilization . ' do you think it 's just an abstract concept ? no , it 's a living force . a collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years . the gods are part of it . you might even say they are the source of it , or at least , they are tied so tightly to it that they could n't possibly fade , not unless all of western civilization were obliterated . the fire started in greece . then , as you well know — or as i hope you know , since you passed my course — the heart of the fire moved to rome , and so did the gods . oh , different names , perhaps — jupiter for zeus , venus for aphrodite , and so on — but the same forces , the same gods . '' `` and then they died . '' `` died ? no . did the west die ? the gods simply moved , to germany , to france , to spain , for a while . wherever the flame was brightest , the gods were there . they spent several [ 72 ] centuries in england . all you need to do is look at the archi- tecture . people do not forget the gods . every place they 've ruled , for the last three thousand years , you can see them in paintings , in statues , on the most important buildings . and yes , percy , of course they are now in your united states . look at your symbol , the eagle of zeus . look at the statue of prometheus in rockefeller center , the greek facades of your government buildings in washington . i defy you to find any american city where the olympians are not promi- nently displayed in multiple places . like it or not — and believe me , plenty of people were n't very fond of rome , either — america is now the heart of the flame . it is the great power of the west . and so olympus is here . and we are here . '' it was all too much , especially the fact that i seemed to be included in chiron 's we , as if i were part of some club . `` who are you , chiron ? who . . . who am i ? '' chiron smiled . he shifted his weight as if he were going to get up out of his wheelchair , but i knew that was impos- sible . he was paralyzed from the waist down . `` who are you ? '' he mused . `` well , that 's the question we all want answered , is n't it ? but for now , we should get you a bunk in cabin eleven . there will be new friends to meet . and plenty of time for lessons tomorrow . besides , there will be s'mores at the campfire tonight , and i simply adore chocolate. `` and then he did rise from his wheelchair . but there was something odd about the way he did it . his blanket fell away from his legs , but the legs did n't move . his waist kept [ 73 ] getting longer , rising above his belt . at first , i thought he was wearing very long , white velvet underwear , but as he kept rising out of the chair , taller than any man , i realized that the velvet underwear was n't underwear ; it was the front of an animal , muscle and sinew under coarse white fur . and the wheelchair was n't a chair . it was some kind of con- tainer , an enormous box on wheels , and it must 've been magic , because there 's no way it could 've held all of him . a leg came out , long and knobby-kneed , with a huge polished hoof . then another front leg , then hindquarters , and then the box was empty , nothing but a metal shell with a couple of fake human legs attached . i stared at the horse who had just sprung from the wheelchair : a huge white stallion . but where its neck should be was the upper body of my latin teacher , smoothly grafted to the horse 's trunk . `` what a relief , '' the centaur said . `` i 'd been cooped up in there so long , my fetlocks had fallen asleep . now , come , percy jackson . let 's meet the other campers . '' [ 74 ] 6 ♦ i become supreme lord of th€ bathroom once i got over the fact that my latin teacher was a horse , we had a nice tour , though i was careful not to walk behind him . i 'd done p ooper- s cooper patrol in the macy 's thanksgiving day parade a few times , and , i 'm sorry , i did not trust chiron 's back end the way i trusted his front . we passed the volleyball pit . several of the campers nudged each other . one pointed to the minotaur horn i was carrying . another said , `` that 's him ! ' most of the campers were older than me . their satyr friends were bigger than grover , all of them trotting around in orange camp half-blood t-shirts , with nothing else to cover their bare shaggy hindquarters . i was n't normally shy , but the way they stared at me made me uncomfortable . i felt like they were expecting me to do a flip or something . i looked back at the farmhouse . it was a lot bigger than i 'd realized — four stories tall , sky blue with white trim , like an upscale seaside resort . i was checking out the brass eagle weather vane on top when something caught my eye , a shadow in the uppermost window of the attic gable . something had moved the curtain , just for a second , and i got the distinct impression i was being watched . `` what 's up there ? '' i asked chiron . [ 75 ] he looked where i was pointing , and his smile faded . `` just the attic . '' `` somebody lives there ? '' `` no , '' he said with finality . `` not a single living thing . '' i got the feeling he was being truthful . but i was also sure something had moved that curtain . `` come along , percy , '' chiron said , his lighthearted tone now a little forced . `` lots to see . '' we walked through the strawberry fields , where campers were picking bushels of berries while a satyr played a tune on a reed pipe . chiron told me the camp grew a nice crop for export to new york restaurants and mount olympus . `` it pays our expenses , '' he explained . `` and the strawberries take almost no effort . '' he said mr. d had this effect on fruit-bearing plants : they just went crazy when he was around . it worked best with wine grapes , but mr. d was restricted from growing those , so they grew strawberries instead . i watched the satyr playing his pipe . his music was causing lines of bugs to leave the strawberry patch in every direction , like refugees fleeing a fire . i wondered if grover could work that kind of magic with music . i wondered if he was still inside the farmhouse , getting chewed out by mr. d. '' grover wo n't get in too much trouble , will he ? '' i asked chiron . `` i mean ... he was a good protector . really . '' chiron sighed . he shed his tweed jacket and draped it over his horse 's back like a saddle . `` grover has big dreams . [ 76 ] percy . perhaps bigger than are reasonable . to reach his goal , he must first demonstrate great courage by succeeding as a keeper , finding a new camper and bringing him safely to half-blood hill . '' `` but he did that ! '' `` i might agree with you , '' chiron said . `` but it is not my place to judge . dionysus and the council of cloven elders must decide . i 'm afraid they might not see this assignment as a success . after all , grover lost you in new york . then there 's the unfortunate . . . ah . . . fate of your mother . and the fact that grover was unconscious when you dragged him over the property line . the council might question whether this shows any courage on grover 's part . '' i wanted to protest . none of what happened was grover 's fault . i also felt really , really guilty . if i had n't given grover the slip at the bus station , he might not have gotten in trouble . `` he 'll get a second chance , wo n't he ? '' chiron winced . `` i 'm afraid that was grover 's second chance , percy . the council was not anxious to give him another , either , after what happened the first time , five years ago . olympus knows , i advised him to wait longer before trying again . he 's still so small for his age . . . . '' `` how old is he ? '' `` oh , twenty-eight . '' `` what ! and he 's in sixth grade ? '' `` satyrs mature half as fast as humans , percy . grover has been the equivalent of a middle school student for the past six years . '' [ 77 ] '' that 's horrible . '' `` quite , '' chiron agreed . `` at any rate , grover is a late bloomer , even by satyr standards , and not yet very accom- plished at woodland magic . alas , he was anxious to pursue his dream . perhaps now he will find some other career . . . `` that 's not fair , '' i said . `` what happened the first time ? was it really so bad ? '' chiron looked away quickly . `` let 's move along , shall we ? '' but i was n't quite ready to let the subject drop . something had occurred to me when chiron talked about my mother 's fate , as if he were intentionally avoiding the word death . the beginnings of an idea — a tiny , hopeful fire — started forming in my mind . `` chiron , '' i said . `` if the gods and olympus and all that are real . . . '' `` yes , child ? '' `` does that mean the underworld is real , too ? '' chiron 's expression darkened . `` yes , child . '' he paused , as if choosing his words care- fully . `` there is a place where spirits go after death . but for now . . . until we know more ... i would urge you to put that out of your mind . '' `` what do you mean , 'until we know more ' ? '' `` come . percy . let 's see the woods . '' as we got closer , i realized how huge the forest was . it took up at least a quarter of the valley , with trees so tall and thick , you could imagine nobody had been in there since the native americans . [ 78 ] chiron said , `` the woods are stocked , if you care to try your luck , but go armed . '' `` stocked with what ? '' i asked . `` armed with what ? '' `` you 'll see . capture the flag is friday night . do you have your own sword and shield ? '' `` my own — ? '' `` no , '' chiron said . `` i do n't suppose you do . i think a size five will do . i 'll visit the armory later . '' i wanted to ask what kind of summer camp had an armory , but there was too much else to think about , so the tour continued . we saw the archery range , the canoeing lake , the stables ( which chiron did n't seem to like very much ) , the javelin range , the sing-along amphitheater , and the arena where chiron said they held sword and spear fights . `` sword and spear fights ? '' i asked . `` cabin challenges and all that , '' he explained . `` not lethal . usually . oh , yes , and there 's the mess hall . '' chiron pointed to an outdoor pavilion framed in white grecian columns on a hill overlooking the sea . there were a dozen stone picnic tables . no roof . no walls . `` what do you do when it rains ? '' i asked . chiron looked at me as if i 'd gone a little weird . `` we still have to eat , do n't we ? '' i decided to drop the subject . finally , he showed me the cabins . there were twelve of them , nestled in the woods by the lake . they were arranged in a u , with two at the base and five in a row on either side . and they were without doubt the most bizarre collection of buildings i 'd ever seen . [ 79 ] except for the fact that each had a large brass number above the door ( odds on the left side , evens on the right ) , they looked absolutely nothing alike . number nine had smokestacks , like a tiny factory . number four had tomato vines on the walls and a roof made out of real grass . seven seemed to be made of solid gold , which gleamed so much in the sunlight it was almost impossible to look at . they all faced a commons area about the size of a soccer field , dot- ted with greek statues , fountains , flower beds , and a couple of basketball hoops ( which were more my speed ) . in the center of the field was a huge stone-lined firepit . even though it was a warm afternoon , the hearth smol- dered . a girl about nine years old was tending the flames , poking the coals with a stick . the pair of cabins at the head of the field , numbers one and two , looked like his-and-hers mausoleums , big white marble boxes with heavy columns in front . cabin one was the biggest and bulkiest of the twelve . its polished bronze doors shimmered like a hologram , so that from different angles lightning bolts seemed to streak across them . cabin two was more graceful somehow , with slimmer columns garlanded with pomegranates and flowers . the walls were carved with images of peacocks . `` zeus and hera ? '' i guessed . `` correct , '' chiron said . `` their cabins look empty . '' `` several of the cabins are . that 's true . no one ever stays in one or two . '' okay . so each cabin had a different god , like a mascot . [ 80 ] twelve cabins for the twelve olympians . but why would some be empty ? i stopped in front of the first cabin on the left , cabin three . it was n't high and mighty like cabin one , but long and low and solid . the outer walls were of rough gray stone studded with pieces of seashell and coral , as if the slabs had been hewn straight from the bottom of the ocean floor . i peeked inside the open doorway and chiron said , `` oh , i would n't do that ! '' before he could pull me back , i caught the salty scent of the interior , like the wind on the shore at montauk . the interior walls glowed like abalone . there were six empty bunk beds with silk sheets turned down . but there was no sign anyone had ever slept there . the place felt so sad and lonely , i was glad when chiron put his hand on my shoul- der and said . `` come along , percy . '' most of the other cabins were crowded with campers . number five was bright red — a real nasty paint job , as if the color had been splashed on with buckets and fists . the roof was lined with barbed wire . a stuffed wild boar 's head hung over the doorway , and its eyes seemed to follow me . inside i could see a bunch of mean-looking kids , both girls and boys , arm wrestling and arguing with each other while rock music blared . the loudest was a girl maybe thirteen or fourteen . she wore a size xxxl camp half- blood t-shirt under a camouflage jacket . she zeroed in on me and gave me an evil sneer . she reminded me of nancy bobofit , though the camper girl was much bigger and [ 81 ] tougher looking , and her hair was long and stringy , and brown instead of red . i kept walking , trying to stay clear of chiron 's hooves . `` we have n't seen any other centaurs , '' i observed . `` no , '' said chiron sadly . `` my kinsmen are a wild and barbaric folk , i 'm afraid . you might encounter them in the wilderness , or at major sporting events . but you wo n't see any here . '' `` you said your name was chiron . are you really . . . '' he smiled down at me . `` the chiron from the stories ? trainer of hercules and all that ? yes , percy , i am . '' `` but , should n't you be dead ? '' chiron paused , as if the question intrigued him . `` i hon- estly do n't know about should be . the truth is , i can ? be dead . you see , eons ago the gods granted my wish . i could con- tinue the work i loved . i could be a teacher of heroes as long as humanity needed me . i gained much from that wish . . . and i gave up much . but i 'm still here , so i can only assume i 'm still needed . '' i thought about being a teacher for three thousand years . it would n't have made my top ten things to wish for list . `` does n't it ever get boring ? '' `` no , no , '' he said . `` horribly depressing , at times , but never boring . '' `` why depressing ? '' chiron seemed to turn hard of hearing again . `` oh , look , '' he said . `` annabeth is waiting for us . '' * * * [ 82 ] the blond girl id met at the big house was reading a book in front of the last cabin on the left , number eleven . when we reached her , she looked me over critically , like she was still thinking about how much i drooled . i tried to see what she was reading , but i could n't make out the title . i thought my dyslexia was acting up . then i realized the title was n't even english . the letters looked greek to me . i mean , literally greek . there were pictures of temples and statues and different kinds of columns , like those in an architecture book . `` annabeth , '' chiron said , `` i have masters ' archery class at noon . would you take percy from here ? '' `` yes , sir . '' `` cabin eleven . '' chiron told me , gesturing toward the doorway . `` make yourself at home . '' out of all the cabins , eleven looked the most like a reg- ular old summer camp cabin , with the emphasis on old . the threshold was worn down , the brown paint peeling . over the doorway was one of those doctor 's symbols , a winged pole with two snakes wrapped around it . what did they call it ... ? a caduceus . inside , it was packed with people , both boys and girls , way more than the number of bunk beds . sleeping bags were spread all over on the floor . it looked like a gym where the red cross had set up an evacuation center . chiron did n't go in . the door was too low for him . but when the campers saw him they all stood and bowed respectfully . [ 83 ] '' well , then , '' chiron said . `` good luck , percy . i 'll see you at dinner . '' he galloped away toward the archery range . i stood in the doorway , looking at the kids . they were n't bowing anymore . they were staring at me , sizing me up . i knew this routine . i 'd gone through it at enough schools . `` well ? '' annabeth prompted . `` go on . '' so naturally i tripped coming in the door and made a total fool of myself . there were some snickers from the campers , but none of them said anything . annabeth announced , `` percy lackson , meet cabin eleven . `` regular or undetermined ? '' somebody asked . i did n't know what to say , but annabeth said , '' undetermined . '' everybody groaned . a guy who was a little older than the rest came forward . `` now , now , campers . that 's what we 're here for . welcome , percy . you can have that spot on the floor , right over there . '' the guy was about nineteen , and he looked pretty cool . he was tall and muscular , with short-cropped sandy hair and a friendly smile . he wore an orange tank top , cutoffs , sandals , and a leather necklace with five different-colored clay beads . the only thing unsettling about his appearance was a thick white scar that ran from just beneath his right eye to his jaw , like an old knife slash . `` this is luke , '' annabeth said , and her voice sounded different somehow . i glanced over and could 've sworn she [ 84 ] was blushing . she saw me looking , and her expression hard- ened again . `` he 's your counselor for now . '' `` for now ? '' i asked . `` you 're undetermined , '' luke explained patiently . `` they do n't know what cabin to put you in , so you 're here . cabin eleven takes all newcomers , all visitors . naturally , we would . hermes , our patron , is the god of travelers . '' i looked at the tiny section of floor they 'd given me . i had nothing to put there to mark it as my own , no luggage , no clothes , no sleeping bag . just the minotaur 's horn . i thought about setting that down , but then i remembered that hermes was also the god of thieves . i looked around at the campers ' faces , some sullen and suspicious , some grinning stupidly , some eyeing me as if they were waiting for a chance to pick my pockets . `` how long will i be here ? '' i asked . `` good question , '' luke said . `` until you 're determined . '' `` how long will that take ? '' the campers all laughed . `` come on , '' annabeth told me . `` i 'll show you the vol- leyball court . '' `` i 've already seen it . '' lome on . she grabbed my wrist and dragged me outside . i could hear the kids of cabin eleven laughing behind me . when we were a few feet away , annabeth said , `` jackson , you have to do better than that . '' `` what ? '' [ 85 ] she rolled her eyes and mumbled under her breath , `` i ca n't believe i thought you were the one . '' `` what 's your problem ? '' i was getting angry now . `` all i know is , i kill some bull guy — `` '' do n't talk like that ! '' annabeth told me . `` you know how many kids at this camp wish they 'd had your chance ? '' `` to get killed ? '' `` to fight the minotaur ! what do you think we train for ? '' i shook my head . `` look , if the thing i fought really was the minotaur , the same one in the stories . . . '' `` yes . '' `` then there 's only one . '' `` yes . '' `` and he died , like , a gajillion years ago , right ? theseus killed him in the labyrinth . so . . . '' `` monsters do n't die , percy . they can be killed . but they do n't die . '' `` oh , thanks . that clears it up . '' `` they do n't have souls , like you and me . you can dispel them for a while , maybe even for a whole lifetime if you 're lucky . but they are primal forces . chiron calls them arche- types . eventually , they re-form . '' i thought about mrs. dodds . `` you mean if i killed one , accidentally , with a sword — `` '' the fur ... i mean , your math teacher . that 's right . she 's still out there . you just made her very , very mad . '' `` how did you know about mrs . dodds ? '' `` you talk in your sleep . '' 186 ] '' you almost called her something . a fury ? they 're hades ' torturers , right ? '' annabeth glanced nervously at the ground , as if she expected it to open up and swallow her . `` you should n't call them by name , even here . we call them the kindly ones , if we have to speak of them at all . '' `` look , is there anything we can say without it thunder- ing ? '' i sounded whiny , even to myself , but right then i did n't care . `` why do i have to stay in cabin eleven , anyway ? why is everybody so crowded together ? there are plenty of empty bunks right over there . '' i pointed to the first few cabins , and annabeth turned pale . `` you do n't just choose a cabin , percy . it depends on who your parents are . or . . . your parent . '' she stared at me , waiting for me to get it . `` my mom is sally jackson . '' i said . `` she works at the candy store in grand central station . at least , she used to . '' `` i 'm sorry about your mom , percy . but that 's not what i mean . i 'm talking about your other parent . your dad . '' `` he 's dead . i never knew him . '' annabeth sighed . clearly , she 'd had this conversation before with other kids . `` your father 's not dead , percy . '' `` how can you say that ? you know him ? '' `` no , of course not . '' `` then how can you say — `` '' because i knowyotr . you would n't be here if you were n't one of us . '' `` you do n't know anything about me . '' `` no ? '' she raised an eyebrow . `` i bet you moved around [ 87 ] from school to school . i bet you were kicked out of a lot of them. `` `` how — `` '' diagnosed with dyslexia . probably adhd , too . '' i tried to swallow my embarrassment . `` what does that have to do with anything ? '' `` taken together , it 's almost a sure sign . the letters float off the page when you read , right ? that 's because your mind is hardwired for ancient greek . and the adhd — you 're impulsive , ca n't sit still in the classroom . that 's your battle- field reflexes . in a real fight , they 'd keep you alive . as for the attention problems , that 's because you see too much , percy , not too little . your senses are better than a regular mortal 's . of course the teachers want you medicated . most of them are monsters . they do n't want you seeing them for what they are . '' `` you sound like . . . you went through the same thing ? '' `` most of the kids here did . if you were n't like us , you could n't have survived the minotaur , much less the ambrosia and nectar . '' `` ambrosia and nectar . '' `` the food and drink we were giving you to make you better . that stuff would 've killed a normal kid . it would 've turned your blood to fire and your bones to sand and you 'd be dead . face it . you 're a half-blood . '' a half-blood . i was reeling with so many questions i did n't know where to start . then a husky voice yelled , `` well ! a newbie ! '' i looked over . the big girl from the ugly red cabin was sauntering toward us . she had three other girls behind her , all big and ugly and mean looking like her , all wearing camo jackets . `` clarisse , '' annabeth sighed . `` why do n't you go polish your spear or something ? '' `` sure , miss princess , '' the big girl said . `` so i can run you through with it friday night . '' `` erre es korakas ! '' annabeth said , which i somehow under- stood was greek for 'go to the crows ! ' though i had a feel- ing it was a worse curse than it sounded . `` you do n't stand a chance . '' `` we 'll pulverize you . '' clarisse said , but her eye twitched . perhaps she was n't sure she could follow through on the threat . she turned toward me . `` who 's this little runt ? '' `` percy jackson , '' annabeth said , `` meet clarisse , daughter of ares . '' i blinked . `` like . . . the war god ? '' clarisse sneered . `` you got a problem with that ? '' `` no , '' i said , recovering my wits . `` it explains the bad smell. `` clarisse growled . `` we got an initiation ceremony for newbies . prissy . '' `` percy. `` `` whatever . come on , i 'll show you . '' `` clarisse — `` annabeth tried to say . `` stay out of it , wise girl . '' annabeth looked pained , but she did stay out of it , and [ 89 ] i did n't really want her help . i was the new kid . i had to earn my own rep. i handed annabeth my minotaur horn and got ready to fight , but before i knew it , clarisse had me by the neck and was dragging me toward a cinder-block building that i knew immediately was the bathroom . i was kicking and punching . i 'd been in plenty of fights before , but this big girl clarisse had hands like iron . she dragged me into the girls ' bathroom . there was a line of toilets on one side and a line of shower stalls down the other . it smelled just like any public bathroom , and i was thinking — as much as i could think with clarisse ripping my hair out — that if this place belonged to the gods , they should 've been able to afford classier johns . clarisse 's friends were all laughing , and i was trying to find the strength i 'd used to fight the minotaur , but it just was n't there . `` like he 's 'big three ' material , '' clarisse said as she pushed me toward one of the toilets . `` yeah , right . minotaur probably fell over laughing , he was so stupid looking . '' her friends snickered . annabeth stood in the corner , watching through her fingers . clarisse bent me over on my knees and started pushing my head toward the toilet bowl . it reeked like rusted pipes and , well , like what goes into toilets . i strained to keep my head up . i was looking at the scummy water , thinking , i will not go into that . i wo n't . [ 90 ] then something happened . i felt a tug in the pit of my stomach . i heard the plumbing rumble , the pipes shudder . clarisse 's grip on my hair loosened . water shot out of the toilet , making an arc straight over my head , and the next thing i knew , i was sprawled on the bathroom tiles with clarisse screaming behind me . i turned just as water blasted out of the toilet again , hit- ting clarisse straight in the face so hard it pushed her down onto her butt . the water stayed on her like the spray from a fire hose , pushing her backward into a shower stall . she struggled , gasping , and her friends started coming toward her . but then the other toilets exploded , too , and six more streams of toilet water blasted them back . the show- ers acted up , too , and together all the fixtures sprayed the camouflage girls right out of the bathroom , spinning them around like pieces of garbage being washed away . as soon as they were out the door , i felt the tug in my gut lessen , and the water shut off as quickly as it had started . the entire bathroom was flooded . annabeth had n't been spared . she was dripping wet . but she had n't been pushed out the door . she was standing in exactly the same place , staring at me in shock . i looked down and realized i was sitting in the only dry spot in the whole room . there was a circle of dry floor around me . 1 did n't have one drop of water on my clothes . nothing . i stood up , my legs shaky . annabeth said , `` how did you . . . '' [ 91 ] '' i do n't know . '' we walked to the door . outside , clarisse and her friends were sprawled in the mud . and a bunch of other campers had gathered around to gawk . clarisse 's hair was flattened across her face . her camouflage jacket was sop- ping and she smelled like sewage . she gave me a look of absolute hatred . `` you are dead , new boy . you are totally dead. `` i probably should have let it go , but i said , `` you want to gargle with toilet water again , clarisse ? close your mouth . `` her friends had to hold her back . they dragged her toward cabin five , while the other campers made way to avoid her flailing feet . annabeth stared at me . i could n't tell whether she was just grossed out or angry at me for dousing her . `` what ? '' i demanded . `` what are you thinking ? '' `` i 'm thinking , '' she said , `` that i want you on my team for capture the flag . '' [ 92 ] my dinner qo€s up in smoi « h word of the bathroom incident spread immediately . wherever i went , campers pointed at me and murmured something about toilet water . or maybe they were just star- ing at annabeth , who was still pretty much dripping wet . she showed me a few more places : the metal shop ( where kids were forging their own swords ) , the arts- and-crafts room ( where satyrs were sandblasting a giant marble statue of a goat-man ) , and the climbing wall , which actually consisted of two facing walls that shook violently , dropped boulders , sprayed lava , and clashed together if you did n't get to the top fast enough . finally we returned to the canoeing lake , where the trail led back to the cabins . `` i 've got training to do , '' annabeth said flatly . `` dinner 's at seven-thirty . just follow your cabin to the mess hall . '' `` annabeth . i 'm sorry about the toilets . '' `` whatever. `` `` it was n't my fault . '' she looked at me skeptically , and i realized it was my fault . i 'd made water shoot out of the bathroom fixtures . i did n't understand how . but the toilets had responded to me . i had become one with the plumbing . [ 93 ] '' you need to talk to the oracle , '' annabeth said . `` who ? '' `` not who . what . the oracle . i 'll ask chiron . '' i stared into the lake , wishing somebody would give me a straight answer for once . i was n't expecting anybody to be looking back at me from the bottom , so my heart skipped a beat when i noticed two teenage girls sitting cross-legged at the base of the pier , about twenty feet below . they wore blue jeans and shim- mering green t-shirts , and their brown hair floated loose around their shoulders as minnows darted in and out . they smiled and waved as if i were a long-lost friend . i did n't know what else to do . i waved back . `` do n't encourage them , '' annabeth warned . `` naiads are terrible flirts . '' `` naiads , '' i repeated , feeling completely overwhelmed . `` that 's it . i want to go home now . '' annabeth frowned . `` do n't you get it , percy ? you are home . this is the only safe place on earth for kids like us . '' `` you mean , mentally disturbed kids ? '' `` i mean not human . not totally human , anyway . half- human. `` `` half-human and half-what ? '' `` i think you know . '' i did n't want to admit it , but i was afraid i did . i felt a tingling in my limbs , a sensation i sometimes felt when my mom talked about my dad . `` god , '' i said . `` half-god . '' 194 ] annabeth nodded . `` your father is n't dead , percy . he 's one of the olympians . '' `` that 's . . . crazy . '' `` is it ? what 's the most common thing gods did in the old stories ? they ran around falling in love with humans and having kids with them . do you think they 've changed their habits in the last few millennia ? '' `` but those are just — `` i almost said myths again . then i remembered chiron 's warning that in two thousand years , / might be considered a myth . `` but if all the kids here are half-gods — `` '' demigods , '' annabeth said . `` that 's the official term . or half-bloods . '' `` then who 's your dad ? '' her hands tightened around the pier railing . i got the feeling i 'd just trespassed on a sensitive subject . `` my dad is a professor at west point , '' she said . `` i have n't seen him since i was very small . he teaches american history . '' `` he 's human . '' `` what ? you assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive ? how sexist is that ? '' `` who 's your mom , then ? '' `` cabin six . '' `` meaning ? '' annabeth straightened . `` athena . goddess of wisdom and battle . '' okay , i thought . why not ? `` and my dad ? '' 195 ] '' undetermined , '' annabeth said , `` like i told you before . nobody knows . '' `` except my mother . she knew . '' `` maybe not , percy . gods do n't always reveal their iden- tities . '' `` my dad would have . he loved her . '' annabeth gave me a cautious look . she did n't want to burst my bubble . `` maybe you 're right . maybe he 'll send a sign . that 's the only way to know for sure : your father has to send you a sign claiming you as his son . sometimes it happens . '' `` you mean sometimes it does n't ? '' annabeth ran her palm along the rail . `` the gods are busy . they have a lot of kids and they do n't always . . . well , sometimes they do n't care about us , percy . they ignore us. ” i thought about some of the kids i 'd seen in the hermes cabin , teenagers who looked sullen and depressed , as if they were waiting for a call that would never come . i 'd known kids like that at yancy academy , shuffled off to boarding school by rich parents who did n't have the time to deal with them . but gods should behave better . `` so i 'm stuck here , '' i said . `` that 's it ? for the rest of my life ? '' `` it depends , '' annabeth said . `` some campers only stay the summer . if you 're a child of aphrodite or demeter , you 're probably not a real powerful force . the monsters might ignore you , so you can get by with a few months of summer training and live in the mortal world the rest of the year . but for some of us , it 's too dangerous to leave . we 're [ 96 ] year- rounders . in the mortal world , we attract monsters . they sense us . they come to challenge us . most of the time , they 'll ignore us until we 're old enough to cause trouble — about ten or eleven years old , but after that , most demigods either make their way here , or they get killed off . a few manage to survive in the outside world and become famous . believe me , if i told you the names , you 'd know them . some do n't even realize they 're demigods . but very , very few are like that . '' `` so monsters ca n't get in here ? '' annabeth shook her head . `` not unless they 're inten- tionally stocked in the woods or specially summoned by somebody on the inside . '' `` why would anybody want to summon a monster ? '' `` practice fights . practical jokes . '' `` practical jokes ? '' `` the point is , the borders are sealed to keep mortals and monsters out . from the outside , mortals look into the valley and see nothing unusual , just a strawberry farm . '' `` so . . . you 're a year-rounder ? '' annabeth nodded . from under the collar of her t-shirt she pulled a leather necklace with five clay beads of differ- ent colors . it was just like luke 's , except annabeth 's also had a big gold ring strung on it , like a college ring . `` i 've been here since i was seven , '' she said . `` every august , on the last day of summer session , you get a bead for surviving another year . i 've been here longer than most of the counselors , and they 're all in college . '' `` why did you come so young ? '' [ 97 ] she twisted the ring on her necklace . `` none of your business . '' `` oh . '' i stood there for a minute in uncomfortable silence . `` so ... i could just walk out of here right now if i wanted to ? '' `` it would be suicide , but you could , with mr. d 's or chiron 's permission . but they would n't give permission until the end of the summer session unless . . . '' `` unless ? '' `` you were granted a quest . but that hardly ever hap- pens . the last time . . . '' her voice trailed off . i could tell from her tone that the last time had n't gone well . `` back in the sick room , '' i said , `` when you were feeding me that stuff — `` '' ambrosia . '' `` yeah . you asked me something about the summer solstice. `` annabeth 's shoulders tensed . `` so you do know some- thing ? '' `` well . . . no . back at my old school . i overheard grover and chiron talking about it . grover mentioned the summer solstice . he said something like we did n't have much time , because of the deadline . what did that mean ? '' she clenched her fists . `` i wish i knew . chiron and the satyrs , they know , but they wo n't tell me . something is wrong in olympus , something pretty major . last time i was there , everything seemed so normal ! ' `` you 've been to olympus ? '' [ 98 ] '' some of us year-rounders — luke and clarisse and i and a few others — we took a field trip during winter solstice . that 's when the gods have their big annual council . '' `` but . . . how did you get there ? '' `` the long island railroad , of course . you get off at penn station . empire state building , special elevator to the six hundredth floor . '' she looked at me like she was sure i must know this already . `` you are a new yorker , right ? '' `` oh , sure . '' as far as i knew , there were only a hundred and two floors in the empire state building , but i decided not to point that out . `` right after we visited , '' annabeth continued , `` the weather got weird , as if the gods had started fighting . a couple of times since . i 've overheard satyrs talking . the best i can figure out is that something important was stolen . and if it is n't returned by summer solstice , there 's going to be trouble . when you came , i was hoping ... i mean — athena can get along with just about anybody , except for ares . and of course she 's got the rivalry with poseidon . but , i mean , aside from that , i thought we could work together . i thought you might know something . '' i shook my head . i wished i could help her , but i felt too hungry and tired and mentally overloaded to ask any more questions . `` eve got to get a quest , '' annabeth muttered to her- self . `` i 'm not too young . if they would just tell me the problem . . . '' i could smell barbecue smoke coming from somewhere [ 99 ] nearby . annabeth must 've heard my stomach growl . she told me to go on , shed catch me later . i left her on the pier , trac- ing her finger across the rail as if drawing a battle plan . back at cabin eleven , everybody was talking and horsing around , waiting for dinner . for the first time , i noticed that a lot of the campers had similar features : sharp noses , upturned eyebrows , mischievous smiles . they were the kind of kids that teachers would peg as troublemakers . thankfully , nobody paid much attention to me as i walked over to my spot on the floor and plopped down with my minotaur horn . the counselor , luke , came over . he had the hermes family resemblance , too . it was marred by that scar on his right cheek , but his smile was intact . `` found you a sleeping bag , '' he said . `` and here , i stole you some toiletries from the camp store . '' i could n't tell if he was kidding about the stealing part . i said , `` thanks . '' `` no prob . '' luke sat next to me , pushed his back against the wall . `` tough first day ? '' `` i do n't belong here , '' i said . `` i do n't even believe in gods . '' `` yeah , '' he said . `` that 's how we all started . once you start believing in them ? it does n't get any easier . '' the bitterness in his voice surprised me , because luke seemed like a pretty easygoing guy . he looked like he could handle just about anything . `` so your dad is hermes ? '' i asked . 1100 ] he pulled a switchblade out of his back pocket , and for a second i thought he was going to gut me , but he just scraped the mud off the sole of his sandal . `` yeah . hermes . `` `` the wing-footed messenger guy . '' `` that 's him . messengers . medicine . travelers , mer- chants , thieves . anybody who uses the roads . that 's why you 're here , enjoying cabin eleven 's hospitality . hermes is n't picky about who he sponsors . '' i figured luke did n't mean to call me a nobody . he just had a lot on his mind . `` you ever meet your dad ? '' i asked . once . i waited , thinking that if he wanted to tell me , he 'd tell me . apparently , he did n't . i wondered if the story had any- thing to do with how he got his scar . luke looked up and managed a smile . `` do n't worry about it , percy . the campers here , they 're mostly good peo- ple . after all , we 're extended family , right ? we take care of each other . '' he seemed to understand how lost i felt , and i was grateful for that , because an older guy like him — even if he was a counselor — should 've steered clear of an uncool middle-schooler like me . but luke had welcomed me into the cabin . he 'd even stolen me some toiletries , which was the nicest thing anybody had done for me all day . i decided to ask him my last big question , the one that had been bothering me all afternoon . `` clarisse , from ares , was joking about me being 'big three ' material . then [ 101 ] annabeth . . . twice , she said i might be 'the one . ' she said i should talk to the oracle . what was that all about ? '' luke folded his knife . `` i hate prophecies . '' `` what do you mean ? '' his face twitched around the scar . `` let 's just say i messed things up for everybody else . the last two years , ever since my trip to the garden of the hesperides went sour , chiron has n't allowed any more quests . annabeth 's been dying to get out into the world . she pestered chiron so much he finally told her he already knew her fate . he 'd had a prophecy from the oracle . he would n't tell her the whole thing , but he said annabeth was n't destined to go on a quest yet . she had to wait until . . . somebody special came to the camp. `` `` somebody special ? '' `` do n't worry about it , kid , '' luke said . `` annabeth wants to think every new camper who comes through here is the omen she 's been waiting for . now , come on , it 's din- nertime. `` the moment he said it , a horn blew in the distance . somehow , i knew it was a conch shell , even though i 'd never heard one before . luke yelled , `` eleven , fall in ! '' the whole cabin , about twenty of us , filed into the commons yard . we lined up in order of seniority , so of course i was dead last . campers came from the other cab- ins , too , except for the three empty cabins at the end , and cabin eight , which had looked normal in the daytime , but was now starting to glow silver as the sun went down . [ 102 ] we marched up the hill to the mess hall pavilion . satyrs joined us from the meadow . naiads emerged from the canoeing lake . a few other girls came out of the woods — and when i say out of the woods , i mean straight out of the woods . i saw one girl , about nine or ten years old , melt from the side of a maple tree and come skipping up the hill . in all , there were maybe a hundred campers , a few dozen satyrs , and a dozen assorted wood nymphs and naiads . at the pavilion , torches blazed around the marble columns . a central fire burned in a bronze brazier the size of a bathtub . each cabin had its own table , covered in white cloth trimmed in purple . four of the tables were empty , but cabin elevens was way overcrowded . i had to squeeze on to the edge of a bench with half my butt hanging off . i saw grover sitting at table twelve with mr. d , a few satyrs , and a couple of plump blond boys who looked just like mr. d. chiron stood to one side , the picnic table being way too small for a centaur . annabeth sat at table six with a bunch of serious- looking athletic kids , all with her gray eyes and honey- blond hair . clarisse sat behind me at ares 's table . shed apparently gotten over being hosed down , because she was laughing and belching right alongside her friends . finally , chiron pounded his hoof against the marble floor of the pavilion , and everybody fell silent . he raised a glass . `` to the gods ! '' everybody else raised their glasses . `` to the gods ! '' wood nymphs came forward with platters of food : [ 103 ] grapes , apples , strawberries , cheese , fresh bread , and yes , barbecue ! my glass was empty , but luke said , `` speak to it . whatever you want — nonalcoholic , of course . '' i said , `` cherry coke . '' the glass filled with sparkling caramel liquid . then i had an idea . `` blue cherry coke . '' the soda turned a violent shade of cobalt . i took a cautious sip . perfect . i drank a toast to my mother . she 's not gone , i told myself . not permanently , anyway . she 's in the underworld . and if that 's a real place , then someday . . . `` here you go , percy , '' luke said , handing me a platter of smoked brisket . i loaded my plate and was about to take a big bite when i noticed everybody getting up , carrying their plates toward the fire in the center of the pavilion . i wondered if they were going for dessert or something . `` come on , '' luke told me . as i got closer , i saw that everyone was taking a portion of their meal and dropping it into the fire , the ripest straw- berry , the juiciest slice of beef , the warmest , most buttery roll . luke murmured in my ear , `` burnt offerings for the gods . they like the smell . '' `` you 're kidding . '' his look warned me not to take this lightly , but i could n't help wondering why an immortal , all-powerful being would like the smell of burning food . 1104 ] luke approached the fire , bowed his head , and tossed in a cluster of fat red grapes . `` hermes . '' i was next . i wished i knew what god 's name to say . finally , i made a silent plea . whoeveryou are , tell me . please . i scraped a big slice of brisket into the flames . when i caught a whiff of the smoke , i did n't gag . it smelled nothing like burning food . it smelled of hot chocolate and fresh-baked brownies , hamburgers on the grill and wildflowers , and a hundred other good things that should n't have gone well together , but did . i could almost believe the gods could live off that smoke . when everybody had returned to their seats and fin- ished eating their meals , chiron pounded his hoof again for our attention . mr. d got up with a huge sigh . `` yes , i suppose i 'd bet- ter say hello to all you brats . well , hello . our activities director , chiron , says the next capture the flag is friday . cabin five presently holds the laurels . '' a bunch of ugly cheering rose from the ares table . `` personally , '' mr. d continued , `` i could n't care less , but congratulations . also , i should tell you that we have a new camper today . peter johnson . '' chiron murmured something . `` er , percy jackson , '' mr. d corrected . `` that 's right . hurrah , and all that . now run along to your silly campfire . go on . '' everybody cheered . we all headed down toward the amphitheater , where apollo 's cabin led a sing-along . we 1105 ] sang camp songs about the gods and ate s'mores and joked around , and the funny thing was , i did n't feel that anyone was staring at me anymore . i felt that i was home . later in the evening , when the sparks from the campfire were curling into a starry sky , the conch horn blew again , and we all filed back to our cabins . i did n't realize how exhausted i was until i collapsed on my borrowed sleeping bag . my fingers curled around the minotaur 's horn . i thought about my mom , but i had good thoughts : her smile , the bedtime stories she would read me when i was a kid , the way she would tell me not to let the bedbugs bite . when i closed my eyes , i fell asleep instantly . that was my first day at camp half-blood . i wish i 'd known how briefly i would get to enjoy my new home . [ 106 ] g l v/e captur6 7 a fla < 4 the next few days i settled into a routine that felt almost normal , if you do n't count the fact that i was getting lessons from satyrs , nymphs , and a centaur . each morning i took ancient greek from annabeth , and we talked about the gods and goddesses in the present tense , which was kind of weird . i discovered annabeth was right about my dyslexia : ancient greek was n't that hard for me to read . at least , no harder than english . after a couple of mornings , i could stumble through a few lines of homer without too much headache . the rest of the day , i 'd rotate through outdoor activi- ties , looking for something i was good at . chiron tried to teach me archery , but we found out pretty quick i was n't any good with a bow and arrow . he did n't complain , even when he had to desnag a stray arrow out of his tail . foot racing ? no good either . the wood-nymph instruc- tors left me in the dust . they told me not to worry about it . they 'd had centuries of practice running away from lovesick gods . but still , it was a little humiliating to be slower than a tree . and wrestling ? forget it . every time i got on the mat , clarisse would pulverize me . [ 107 ] '' theres more where that came from , punk , '' she 'd mumble in my ear . the only thing i really excelled at was canoeing , and that was n't the kind of heroic skill people expected to see from the kid who had beaten the minotaur . i knew the senior campers and counselors were watch- ing me , trying to decide who my dad was , but they were n't having an easy time of it . i was n't as strong as the ares kids , or as good at archery as the apollo kids . i did n't have hephaestus 's skill with metalwork or — gods forbid — dionysus 's way with vine plants . luke told me i might be a child of hermes , a kind of jack-of-all-trades , master of none . but i got the feeling he was just trying to make me feel better . he really did n't know what to make of me either . despite all that , i liked camp . i got used to the morn- ing fog over the beach , the smell of hot strawberry fields in the afternoon , even the weird noises of monsters in the woods at night . i would eat dinner with cabin eleven , scrape part of my meal into the fire , and try to feel some connec- tion to my real dad . nothing came . just that warm feeling i 'd always had , like the memory of his smile . i tried not to think too much about my mom , but i kept wondering : if gods and monsters were real , if all this magical stuff was possible , surely there was some way to save her , to bring her back . . . . i started to understand luke 's bitterness and how he seemed to resent his father , hermes . so okay , maybe gods had important things to do . but could n't they call once in a [ 108 ] while , or thunder , or something ? dionysus could make diet coke appear out of thin air . why could n't my dad , who- ever he was , make a phone appear ? thursday afternoon , three days after i 'd arrived at camp half-blood , i had my first sword-fighting lesson . every- body from cabin eleven gathered in the big circular arena , where luke would be our instructor . we started with basic stabbing and slashing , using some straw-stuffed dummies in greek armor . i guess i did okay . at least . i understood what i was supposed to do and my reflexes were good . the problem was , i could n't find a blade that felt right in my hands . either they were too heavy , or too light , or too long . luke tried his best to fix me up , but he agreed that none of the practice blades seemed to work for me . we moved on to dueling in pairs . luke announced he would be my partner , since this was my first time . `` good luck , '' one of the campers told me . `` luke 's the best swordsman in the last three hundred years . '' `` maybe he 'll go easy on me , '' i said . the camper snorted . luke showed me thrusts and parries and shield blocks the hard way . with every swipe , i got a little more battered and bruised . `` keep your guard up , percy , '' he 'd say , then whap me in the ribs with the flat of his blade . `` no , not that far up ! '' whap ! `` lunge ! '' whap ! `` now , back ! '' whap ! by the time he called a break , i was soaked in sweat . everybody swarmed the drinks cooler . luke poured ice [ 109 ] water on his head , which looked like such a good idea , i did the same . instantly , i felt better . strength surged back into my arms . the sword did n't feel so awkward . `` okay , everybody circle up ! '' luke ordered . `` if percy does n't mind . i want to give you a little demo . '' great , i thought . let 's all watch percy get pounded . the hermes guys gathered around . they were sup- pressing smiles . i figured they 'd been in my shoes before and could n't wait to see how luke used me for a punching bag . he told everybody he was going to demonstrate a disarm- ing technique : how to twist the enemy 's blade with the flat of your own sword so that he had no choice but to drop his weapon . `` this is difficult , '' he stressed . `` tve had it used against me . no laughing at percy , now . most swordsmen have to work years to master this technique . '' he demonstrated the move on me in slow motion . sure enough , the sword clattered out of my hand . `` now in real time , '' he said , after i 'd retrieved my weapon . `` we keep sparring until one of us pulls it off . ready , percy ? '' i nodded , and luke came after me . somehow , i kept him from getting a shot at the hilt of my sword . my senses opened up . i saw his attacks coming . i countered . i stepped forward and tried a thrust of my own . luke deflected it eas- ily , but i saw a change in his face . his eyes narrowed , and he started to press me with more force . the sword grew heavy in my hand . the balance was n't [ 110 ] right . i knew it was only a matter of seconds before luke took me down , so i figured . what the heck ? i tried the disarming maneuver . my blade hit the base of luke 's and i twisted , putting my whole weight into a downward thrust . clang . luke 's sword rattled against the stones . the tip of my blade was an inch from his undefended chest . the other campers were silent . i lowered my sword . `` um , sorry . '' for a moment , luke was too stunned to speak . `` sorry ? '' his scarred face broke into a grin . `` by the gods , percy , why are you sorry ? show me that again ! '' i did n't want to . the short burst of manic energy had completely abandoned me . but luke insisted . this time , there was no contest . the moment our swords connected , luke hit my hilt and sent my weapon skidding across the floor . after a long pause , somebody in the audience said , '' beginner 's luck ? '' luke wiped the sweat off his brow . he appraised at me with an entirely new interest . `` maybe , '' he said . `` but i won- der what percy could do with a balanced sword . . . . '' friday afternoon , i was sitting with grover at the lake , rest- ing from a near-death experience on the climbing wall . grover had scampered to the top like a mountain goat , but the lava had almost gotten me . my shirt had smoking holes in it . the hairs had been singed off my forearms . [ ill ] we sat on the pier , watching the naiads do underwater basket- weaving , until i got up the nerve to ask grover how his conversation had gone with mr. d. his face turned a sickly shade of yellow . `` fine , '' he said . `` just great . '' `` so your career 's still on track ? '' he glanced at me nervously . `` chiron t-told you i want a searcher 's license ? '' `` well ... no . '' i had no idea what a searcher 's license was , but it did n't seem like the right time to ask . `` he just said you had big plans , you know . . . and that you needed credit for completing a keeper 's assignment . so did you get it ? '' grover looked down at the naiads . `` mr. d suspended judgment . he said i had n't failed or succeeded with you yet , so our fates were still tied together . if you got a quest and i went along to protect you , and we both came back alive , then maybe he 'd consider the job complete . '' my spirits lifted . `` well , that 's not so bad , right ? '' `` blaa~ha~ha ! he might as well have transferred me to stable-cleaning duty . the chances of you getting a quest . . . and even if you did , why would you want me along ? '' `` of course i 'd want you along ! '' grover stared glumly into the water . `` basket-weaving . . . must be nice to have a useful skill . '' i tried to reassure him that he had lots of talents , but that just made him look more miserable . we talked about canoeing and swordplay for a while , then debated the pros and cons of the different gods . finally , i asked him about the four empty cabins . [ 112 ] '' number eight , the silver one , belongs to artemis , '' he said . `` she vowed to be a maiden forever . so of course , no kids . the cabin is , you know , honorary . if she did n't have one , she 'd be mad . '' `` yeah , okay . but the other three , the ones at the end . are those the big three ? '' grover tensed . we were getting close to a touchy subject . `` no . one of them , number two , is hera 's , '' he said . `` that 's another honorary thing . she 's the goddess of marriage , so of course she would n't go around having affairs with mor- tals . that 's her husband 's job . when we say the big three , we mean the three powerful brothers , the sons of kronos . '' `` zeus , poseidon , hades . '' `` right . you know . after the great battle with the titans , they took over the world from their dad and drew lots to decide who got what . '' `` zeus got the sky , '' i remembered . `` poseidon the sea . hades the underworld . '' `` uh-huh . '' `` but hades does n't have a cabin here . '' `` no . he does n't have a throne on olympus , either . he sort of does his own thing down in the underworld . if he did have a cabin here . . . '' grover shuddered . `` well , it would n't be pleasant . let 's leave it at that . '' `` but zeus and poseidon — they both had . like , a bazil- lion kids in the myths . why are their cabins empty ? '' grover shifted his hooves uncomfortably . `` about sixty years ago , after world war ii , the big three agreed they would n't sire any more heroes . their children were just too [ 113 ] powerful . they were affecting the course of human events too much , causing too much carnage . world war ii , you know , that was basically a fight between the sons of zeus and poseidon on one side , and the sons of hades on the other . the winning side , zeus and poseidon , made hades swear an oath with them : no more affairs with mortal women . they all swore on the river styx . '' thunder boomed . i said , `` that 's the most serious oath you can make . '' grover nodded . `` and the brothers kept their word — no kids ? '' grover 's face darkened . `` seventeen years ago , zeus fell off the wagon . there was this tv starlet with a big fluffy eighties hairdo — he just could n't help himself . when their child was born , a little girl named thalia . . . well , the river styx is serious about promises . zeus himself got off easy because he 's immortal , but he brought a terrible fate on his daughter. `` `` but that is n't fair ! it was n't the little girl 's fault . '' grover hesitated . `` percy , children of the big three have powers greater than other half-bloods . they have a strong aura , a scent that attracts monsters . when hades found out about the girl , he was n't too happy about zeus breaking his oath . hades let the worst monsters out oftartarus to tor- ment thalia . a satyr was assigned to be her keeper when she was twelve , but there was nothing he could do . he tried to escort her here with a couple of other half-bloods she 'd befriended . they almost made it . they got all the way to the top of that hill . '' 1114 ] he pointed across the valley , to the pine tree where id fought the minotaur . `` all three kindly ones were after them , along with a hoard of hellhounds . they were about to be overrun when thalia told her satyr to take the other two half-bloods to safety while she held off the monsters . she was wounded and tired , and she did n't want to live like a hunted animal . the satyr did n't want to leave her , but he could n't change her mind , and he had to protect the others . so thalia made her final stand alone , at the top of that hill . as she died , zeus took pity on her . he turned her into that pine tree . her spirit still helps protect the borders of the valley . that 's why the hill is called half-blood hill . '' i stared at the pine in the distance . the story made me feel hollow , and guilty too . a girl my age had sacrificed herself to save her friends . she had faced a whole army of monsters . next to that , my victory over the minotaur did n't seem like much . i wondered , if i 'd acted differently , could i have saved my mother ? `` grover , '' i said , `` have heroes really gone on quests to the underworld ? '' `` sometimes , '' he said . `` orpheus . hercules . houdini . '' `` and have they ever returned somebody from the dead ? '' `` no . never . orpheus came close . . . . percy , you 're not seriously thinking — `` '' no , '' i lied . `` i was just wondering . so ... a satyr is always assigned to guard a demigod ? '' grover studied me warily . i had n't persuaded him that i 'd really dropped the underworld idea . `` not always . we go [ 115 ] undercover to a lot of schools . we try to sniff out the half- bloods who have the makings of great heroes . if we find one with a very strong aura , like a child of the big three , we alert chiron . he tries to keep an eye on them , since they could cause really huge problems . '' `` and you found me . chiron said you thought i might be something special . '' grover looked as if id just led him into a trap . `` i did n't . . . oh , listen , do n't think like that . if you were — you know — you 'd never ever be allowed a quest , and i 'd never get my license . you 're probably a child of hermes . or maybe even one of the minor gods , like nemesis , the god of revenge . do n't worry , okay ? '' i got the idea he was reassuring himself more than me . that night after dinner , there was a lot more excitement than usual . at last , it was time for capture the flag . when the plates were cleared away , the conch horn sounded and we all stood at our tables . campers yelled and cheered as annabeth and two of her siblings ran into the pavilion carrying a silk banner . it was about ten feet long , glistening gray , with a painting of a barn owl above an olive tree . from the opposite side of the pavilion , clarisse and her buddies ran in with another banner , of identical size , but gaudy red , painted with a bloody spear and a boar 's head . i turned to luke and yelled over the noise , `` those are the flags ? '' [ 116 ] yeah . `` ares and athena always lead the teams ? '' `` not always , '' he said . `` but often . '' `` so , if another cabin captures one , what do you do — repaint the flag ? '' he grinned . `` you 'll see . first we have to get one . '' `` whose side are we on ? '' he gave me a sly look , as if he knew something i did n't . the scar on his face made him look almost evil in the torchlight . `` we 've made a temporary alliance with athena . tonight , we get the flag from ares . and you are going to help. `` the teams were announced . athena had made an alliance with apollo and hermes , the two biggest cabins . apparently , privileges had been traded — shower times , chore schedules , the best slots for activities — in order to win support . ares had allied themselves with everybody else : dionysus , demeter , aphrodite , and hephaestus . from what i 'd seen , dionysus 's kids were actually good athletes , but there were only two of them . demeter 's kids had the edge with nature skills and outdoor stuff , but they were n't very aggressive . aphrodite 's sons and daughters i was n't too wor- ried about . they mostly sat out every activity and checked their reflections in the lake and did their hair and gossiped . hephaestus 's kids were n't pretty , and there were only four of them , but they were big and burly from working in the metal shop all day . they might be a problem . that , of course , left ares 's cabin : a dozen of the biggest , ugliest , [ 117 ] meanest kids on long island , or anywhere else on the planet . chiron hammered his hoof on the marble . `` heroes ! '' he announced . `` you know the rules . the creek is the boundary line . the entire forest is fair game . all magic items are allowed . the banner must be prominently displayed , and have no more than two guards . prisoners may be disarmed , but may not be bound or gagged . no killing or maiming is allowed . i will serve as referee and battlefield medic . arm yourselves ! '' he spread his hands , and the tables were suddenly cov- ered with equipment : helmets , bronze swords , spears , oxhide shields coated in metal . `` whoa , '' i said . `` we 're really supposed to use these ? '' luke looked at me as if i were crazy . `` unless you want to get skewered by your friends in cabin five . here — chiron thought these would fit . you 'll be on border patrol . '' my shield was the size of an nba backboard , with a big caduceus in the middle . it weighed about a million pounds . i could have snowboarded on it fine , but i hoped nobody seriously expected me to run fast . my helmet , like all the helmets on athena 's side , had a blue horsehair plume on top . ares and their allies had red plumes . annabeth yelled , `` blue team , forward ! '' we cheered and shook our swords and followed her down the path to the south woods . the red team yelled taunts at us as they headed off toward the north . i managed to catch up with annabeth without tripping over my equipment . `` hey . '' [ 118 ] she kept marching . `` so what 's the plan ? '' i asked . `` got any magic items you can loan me ? '' her hand drifted toward her pocket , as if she were afraid i 'd stolen something . `` just watch clarisse 's spear , '' she said . `` you do n't want that thing touching you . otherwise , do n't worry . we 'll take the banner from ares . has luke given you your job ? '' `` border patrol , whatever that means . '' `` it 's easy . stand by the creek , keep the reds away . leave the rest to me . athena always has a plan . '' she pushed ahead , leaving me in the dust . `` okay , '' i mumbled . `` glad you wanted me on your team . '' it was a warm , sticky night . the woods were dark , with fireflies popping in and out of view . annabeth stationed me next to a little creek that gurgled over some rocks , then she and the rest of the team scattered into the trees . standing there alone , with my big blue-feathered helmet and my huge shield , i felt like an idiot . the bronze sword , like all the swords i 'd tried so far , seemed balanced wrong . the leather grip pulled on my hand like a bowling ball . there was no way anybody would actually attack me , would they ? i mean , olympus had to have liability issues , right ? far away , the conch horn blew . i heard whoops and yells in the woods , the clanking of metal , kids fighting . a blue- plumed ally from apollo raced past me like a deer , leaped through the creek , and disappeared into enemy territory . great , i thought . i 'll miss all the fun , as usual . [ 119 ] then i heard a sound that sent a chill up my spine , a low canine growl , somewhere close by . i raised my shield instinctively ; i had the feeling some- thing was stalking me . then the growling stopped . i felt the presence retreat- ing . on the other side of the creek , the underbrush ex- ploded . five ares warriors came yelling and screaming out of the dark . `` cream the punk ! '' clarisse screamed . her ugly pig eyes glared through the slits of her helmet . she brandished a five-foot-long spear , its barbed metal tip flickering with red light . her siblings had only the standard- issue bronze swords — not that that made me feel any better . they charged across the stream . there was no help in sight . i could run . or i could defend myself against half the ares cabin . i managed to sidestep the first kid 's swing , but these guys were not as stupid the minotaur . they surrounded me , and clarisse thrust at me with her spear . my shield deflected the point , but i felt a painful tingling all over my body . my hair stood on end . my shield arm went numb , and the air burned . electricity . her stupid spear was electric . i fell back . another ares guy slammed me in the chest with the butt of his sword and i hit the dirt . they could 've kicked me into jelly , but they were too busy laughing . `` give him a haircut , '' clarisse said . `` grab his hair . '' [ 1201 i managed to get to my feet . i raised my sword , but clarisse slammed it aside with her spear as sparks flew . now both my arms felt numb . `` oh , wow , '' clarisse said . `` i 'm scared of this guy . really scared. `` `` the flag is that way , '' i told her . i wanted to sound angry , but i was afraid it did n't come out that way . `` yeah , '' one of her siblings said . `` but see . we do n't care about the flag . we care about a guy who made our cabin look stupid . '' `` you do that without my help , '' i told them . it proba- bly was n't the smartest thing to say . two of them came at me . i backed up toward the creek , tried to raise my shield , but clarisse was too fast . her spear stuck me straight in the ribs . if i had n't been wearing an armored breastplate , i would 've been shish-ke-babbed . as it was , the electric point just about shocked my teeth out of my mouth . one of her cabinmates slashed his sword across my arm , leaving a good-size cut . seeing my own blood made me dizzy — warm and cold at the same time . `` no maiming , '' i managed to say . `` oops , '' the guy said . `` guess i lost my dessert privi- lege . he pushed me into the creek and i landed with a splash . they all laughed . i figured as soon as they were through being amused , i would die . but then something happened . the water seemed to wake up my senses , as if i 'd just had a bag of my mom 's double-espresso jelly beans . [ 121 ] clarisse and her cabinmates came into the creek to get me , but i stood to meet them . i knew what to do . i swung the flat of my sword against the first guy 's head and knocked his helmet clean off . i hit him so hard i could see his eyes vibrating as he crumpled into the water . ugly number two and ugly number three came at me . i slammed one in the face with my shield and used my sword to shear off the other guy 's horsehair plume . both of them backed up quick . ugly number four did n't look really anxious to attack , but clarisse kept coming , the point of her spear crackling with energy . as soon as she thrust , i caught the shaft between the edge of my shield and my sword , and i snapped it like a twig . `` ah ! '' she screamed . `` you idiot ! you corpse-breath worm ! `` she probably would 've said worse , but i smacked her between the eyes with my sword-butt and sent her stum- bling backward out of the creek . then i heard yelling , elated screams , and i saw luke racing toward the boundary line with the red team 's banner lifted high . he was flanked by a couple of hermes guys covering his retreat , and a few apollos behind them , fight- ing off the hephaestus kids . the ares folks got up , and clarisse muttered a dazed curse . `` a trick ! '' she shouted . `` it was a trick . '' they staggered after luke , but it was too late . everybody converged on the creek as luke ran across into friendly territory . our side exploded into cheers . the red banner shimmered and turned to silver . the boar and spear 1122 ] were replaced with a huge caduceus , the symbol of cabin eleven . everybody on the blue team picked up luke and started carrying him around on their shoulders . chiron can- tered out from the woods and blew the conch horn . the game was over . wed won . i was about to join the celebration when annabeth 's voice , right next to me in the creek , said , `` not bad , hero . '' i looked , but she was n't there . `` where the heck did you learn to fight like that ? '' she asked . the air shimmered , and she materialized , holding a yankees baseball cap as if she 'd just taken it off her head . i felt myself getting angry . i was n't even fazed by the fact that she 'd just been invisible . `` you set me up , '' i said . `` you put me here because you knew clarisse would come after me , while you sent luke around the flank . you had it all figured out . '' annabeth shrugged . `` i told you . athena always , always has a plan . '' `` a plan to get me pulverized . '' `` i came as fast as i could . i was about to jump in , but . . . '' she shrugged . `` you did n't need help . '' then she noticed my wounded arm . `` how did you do that ? '' `` sword cut , '' i said . `` what do you think ? '' `` no . it was a sword cut . look at it . '' the blood was gone . where the huge cut had been , there was a long white scratch , and even that was fading . as i watched , it turned into a small scar , and disap- peared . [ 1231 '' i — i do n't get it , '' i said . annabeth was thinking hard . i could almost see the gears turning . she looked down at my feet , then at clarisse 's broken spear , and said , `` step out of the water , percy . '' `` what^ '' '' just do it . '' i came out of the creek and immediately felt bone tired . my arms started to go numb again . my adrenaline rush left me . i almost fell over , but annabeth steadied me . `` oh , styx , '' she cursed . `` this is not good . i did n't want ... i assumed it would be zeus . . . . '' before i could ask what she meant , i heard that canine growl again , but much closer than before . a howl ripped through the forest . the campers ' cheering died instantly . chiron shouted something in ancient greek , which i would realize , only later , i had understood perfectly : `` stand ready ! my bow ! '' annabeth drew her sword . there on the rocks just above us was a black hound the size of a rhino , with lava-red eyes and fangs like daggers . it was looking straight at me . nobody moved except annabeth , who yelled , `` percy , run ! '' she tried to step in front of me , but the hound was too fast . it leaped over her — an enormous shadow with teeth — and just as it hit me , as i stumbled backward and felt its razor-sharp claws ripping through my armor , there was a cascade of thwacking sounds , like forty pieces of paper [ 124 ] being ripped one after the other . from the hound 's neck sprouted a cluster of arrows . the monster fell dead at my feet . by some miracle , 1 was still alive . i did n't want to look underneath the ruins of my shredded armor . my chest felt warm and wet , and i knew i was badly cut . another second , and the monster would 've turned me into a hundred pounds of delicatessen meat . chiron trotted up next to us , a bow in his hand , his face grim . `` di immortahs ! '' annabeth said . `` that 's a hellhound from the fields of punishment . they do n't . . . they 're not supposed to . . . '' `` someone summoned it , '' chiron said . `` someone inside the camp . '' luke came over , the banner in his hand forgotten , his moment of glory gone . clarisse yelled , `` it 's all percy 's fault ! percy summoned it ! '' `` be quiet , child , '' chiron told her . we watched the body of the hellhound melt into shadow , soaking into the ground until it disappeared . `` you 're wounded , '' annabeth told me . `` quick , percy , get in the water . '' `` i 'm okay . '' `` no , you 're not , '' she said . `` chiron , watch this . '' i was too tired to argue . i stepped back into the creek , the whole camp gathering around me . instantly , i felt better . i could feel the cuts on my chest closing up . some of the campers gasped . h25 ] '' look , i — i do n't know why , '' i said , trying to apolo- gize . `` i 'm sorry . . . . '' but they were n't watching my wounds heal . they were staring at something above my head . `` percy , '' annabeth said , pointing . `` um . . . '' by the time i looked up , the sign was already fading , but i could still make out the hologram of green light , spinning and gleaming . a three-tipped spear : a trident . `` your father , '' annabeth murmured . `` this is really not good. `` `` it is determined , '' chiron announced . all around me , campers started kneeling , even the ares cabin , though they did n't look happy about it . `` my father ? '' i asked , completely bewildered . `` poseidon , '' said chiron . `` earthshaker , stormbringer , father of horses . hail , perseus jackson , son of the sea god . '' 1126 ] 9 i i am off€r€d 7 7 a qu€st the next morning , chiron moved me to cabin three . i did n't have to share with anybody . i had plenty of room for all my stuff : the minotaur 's horn , one set of spare clothes , and a toiletry bag . i got to sit at my own dinner table , pick all my own activities , call `` lights out '' whenever i felt like it , and not listen to anybody else . and i was absolutely miserable . just when i 'd started to feel accepted , to feel i had a home in cabin eleven and i might be a normal kid — or as normal as you can be when you 're a half-blood — i 'd been separated out as if i had some rare disease . nobody mentioned the hellhound , but i got the feeling they were all talking about it behind my back . the attack had scared everybody . it sent two messages : one , that i was the son of the sea god ; and two , monsters would stop at nothing to kill me . they could even invade a camp that had always been considered safe . the other campers steered clear of me as much as possi- ble . cabin eleven was too nervous to have sword class with me after what i 'd done to the ares folks in the woods , so my les- sons with luke became one-on-one . he pushed me harder than ever , and was n't afraid to bruise me up in the process . [ 127 ] '' you 're going to need all the training you can get , '' he promised , as we were working with swords and flaming torches . `` now let 's try that viper-beheading strike again . fifty more repetitions . '' annabeth still taught me greek in the mornings , but she seemed distracted . every time i said something , she scowled at me , as if i 'd just poked her between the eyes . after lessons , she would walk away muttering to herself : '' quest . . . poseidon ? . . . dirty rotten . . . got to make a plan . . . '' even clarisse kept her distance , though her venomous looks made it clear she wanted to kill me for breaking her magic spear . i wished she would just yell or punch me or something . i 'd rather get into fights every day than be ignored . i knew somebody at camp resented me , because one night i came into my cabin and found a mortal newspaper dropped inside the doorway , a copy of the new york daily news , opened to the metro page . the article took me almost an hour to read , because the angrier i got , the more the words floated around on the page . boy and mother still missing after freak car accident by eileen smythe sally jackson and son percy are still missing one week after their mysterious disappearance . the family 's 1128 ] badly burned '78 camaro was discovered last saturday on a north long island road with the roof ripped off and the front axle broken . the car had flipped and skidded for several hundred feet before exploding . mother and son had gone for a weekend vacation to montauk , but left hastily , under mysterious circum- stances . small traces of blood were found in the car and near the scene of the wreck , but there were no other signs of the missing jacksons . residents in the rural area reported seeing nothing unusual around the time of the accident . ms. jackson 's husband , gabe ugliano , claims that his stepson , percy jackson , is a troubled child who has been kicked out of numerous boarding schools and has expressed violent tendencies in the past . police would not say whether son percy is a suspect in his mother 's disappearance , but they have not ruled out foul play . below are recent pictures of sally jackson and percy . police urge anyone with informa- tion to call the following toll-free crime-stoppers hotline . the phone number was circled in black marker . i wadded up the paper and threw it away , then flopped down in my bunk bed in the middle of my empty cabin . `` lights out , '' i told myself miserably . that night , i had my worst dream yet . i was running along the beach in a storm . this time , [ 129 ] there was a city behind me . not new york . the sprawl was different : buildings spread farther apart , palm trees and low hills in the distance . about a hundred yards down the surf , two men were fighting . they looked like tv wrestlers , muscular , with beards and long hair . both wore flowing greek tunics , one trimmed in blue , the other in green . they grappled with each other , wrestled , kicked and head-butted , and every time they connected , lightning flashed , the sky grew darker , and the wind rose . i had to stop them . i did n't know why . but the harder i ran , the more the wind blew me back , until i was running in place , my heels digging uselessly in the sand . over the roar of the storm , i could hear the blue-robed one yelling at the green-robed one , give it back ! give it back ! like a kindergartner fighting over a toy . the waves got bigger , crashing into the beach , spraying me with salt . i yelled , stop it ! stop fighting ! the ground shook . laughter came from somewhere under the earth , and a voice so deep and evil it turned my blood to ice . come down , little hero , the voice crooned . come down ! the sand split beneath me , opening up a crevice straight down to the center of the earth . my feet slipped , and dark- ness swallowed me . i woke up , sure i was falling . i was still in bed in cabin three . my body told me it was morning , but it was dark outside , and thunder rolled across [ 130 ] the hills . a storm was brewing . i had n't dreamed that . i heard a clopping sound at the door , a hoof knocking on the threshold . `` come in ? '' grover trotted inside , looking worried . `` mr. d wants to see you . '' `` why ? '' `` he wants to kill ... i mean . i 'd better let him tell you . '' nervously , i got dressed and followed , sure that i was in huge trouble . for days , i 'd been half expecting a summons to the big house . now that i was declared a son of poseidon , one of the bigthree gods who were n't supposed to have kids , i fig- ured it was a crime for me just to be alive . the other gods had probably been debating the best way to punish me for existing , and now mr. d was ready to deliver their verdict . over long island sound , the sky looked like ink soup coming to a boil . a hazy curtain of rain was coming in our direction . i asked grover if we needed an umbrella . `` no , '' he said . `` it never rains here unless we want it to . '' i pointed at the storm . `` what the heck is that , then ? '' he glanced uneasily at the sky . `` it 'll pass around us . bad weather always does . '' i realized he was right . in the week i 'd been here , it had never even been overcast . the few rain clouds i 'd seen had skirted right around the edges of the valley . but this storm . . . this one was huge . at the volleyball pit , the kids from apollo 's cabin were playing a morning game against the satyrs . dionysus 's twins h31 ] were walking around in the strawberry fields , making the plants grow . everybody was going about their normal busi- ness , but they looked tense . they kept their eyes on the storm . grover and i walked up to the front porch of the big house . dionysus sat at the pinochle table in his tiger- striped hawaiian shirt with his diet coke , just as he had on my first day . chiron sat across the table in his fake wheel- chair . they were playing against invisible opponents — two sets of cards hovering in the air . `` well , well , '' mr. d said without looking up . `` our little celebrity . '' i waited . `` come closer , '' mr. d said . `` and do n't expect me to kowtow to you , mortal , just because old barnacle-beard is your father . '' a net of lightning flashed across the clouds . thunder shook the windows of the house . `` blah , blah , blah , '' dionysus said . chiron feigned interest in his pinochle cards . grover cowered by the railing , his hooves clopping back and forth . `` if i had my way , '' dionysus said , `` i would cause your molecules to erupt in flames . we 'd sweep up the ashes and be done with a lot of trouble . but chiron seems to feel this would be against my mission at this cursed camp : to keep you little brats safe from harm . '' `` spontaneous combustion is a form of harm , mr. d , '' chiron put in . `` nonsense , '' dionysus said . `` boy would n't feel a thing . 1132 ] nevertheless , i 've agreed to restrain myself . i 'm thinking of turning you into a dolphin instead , sending you back to your father . '' `` mr. d — `` chiron warned . `` oh , all right , '' dionysus relented . `` there 's one more option . but it 's deadly foolishness . '' dionysus rose , and the invisible players ' cards dropped to the table . `` i 'm off to olympus for the emergency meeting . if the boy is still here when i get back . i 'll turn him into an atlantic bottlenose . do you understand ? and perseus jackson , if you 're at all smart , you 'll see that 's a much more sensible choice than what chiron feels you must do . '' dionysus picked up a playing card , twisted it , and it became a plastic rectangle . a credit card ? no . a security pass . he snapped his fingers . the air seemed to fold and bend around him . he became a hologram , then a wind , then he was gone , leaving only the smell of fresh-pressed grapes lingering behind . chiron smiled at me , but he looked tired and strained . `` sit , percy , please . and grover . '' we did . chiron laid his cards on the table , a winning hand he had n't gotten to use . `` tell me , percy , '' he said . `` what did you make of the hellhound ? '' just hearing the name made me shudder . chiron probably wanted me to say , heck , it was nothing . i eat hellhounds for breakfast . but i did n't feel like lying . `` it scared me , '' i said . `` if you had n't shot it . i 'd be dead . '' 1133 ] '' you 'll meet worse , percy . far worse , before you 're done. `` `` done . . . with what ? '' `` your quest , of course . will you accept it ? '' i glanced at grover , who was crossing his fingers . `` um , sir , '' i said , `` you have n't told me what it is yet . '' chiron grimaced . `` well , that 's the hard part , the details. `` thunder rumbled across the valley . the storm clouds had now reached the edge of the beach . as far as i could see , the sky and the sea were boiling together . `` poseidon and zeus , '' i said . `` they 're fighting over something valuable . . . something that was stolen , are n't they ? '' chiron and grover exchanged looks . chiron sat forward in his wheelchair . `` how did you know that ? '' my face felt hot . i wished i had n't opened my big mouth . `` the weather since christmas has been weird , like the sea and the sky are fighting . t h e n i talked to annabeth , and she 'd overheard something about a theft . and . . . i 've also been having these dreams . '' `` i knew it , '' grover said . `` hush , satyr , '' chiron ordered . `` but it is his quest ! '' grover 's eyes were bright with excitement . `` it must be ! '' `` only the oracle can determine . '' chiron stroked his bristly beard . `` nevertheless , percy , you are correct . your father and zeus are having their worst quarrel in centuries . h34 ] they are fighting over something valuable that was stolen . to be precise : a lightning bolt . '' i laughed nervously . `` a what ? '' `` do not take this lightly , '' chiron warned . `` i 'm not talking about some tinfoil-covered zigzag you 'd see in a second-grade play . i 'm talking about a two-foot-long cylin- der of high-grade celestial bronze , capped on both ends with god-level explosives . '' `` oh . '' `` zeus 's master bolt , '' chiron said , getting worked up now . `` the symbol of his power , from which all other light- ning bolts are patterned . the first weapon made by the cyclopes for the war against the titans , the bolt that sheered the top off mount etna and hurled kronos from his throne ; the master bolt , which packs enough power to make mortal hydrogen bombs look like firecrackers . '' `` and it 's missing ? '' `` stolen , '' chiron said . `` by who ? '' `` by whom '' chiron corrected . once a teacher , always a teacher . `` by you . '' my mouth fell open . `` at least '' — chiron held up a hand — `` that 's what zeus thinks . during the winter solstice , at the last council of the gods , zeus and poseidon had an argument . the usual nonsense : 'mother rhea always liked you best , ' air dis- asters are more spectacular than sea disasters , ' et cetera . afterward , zeus realized his master bolt was missing , taken from the throne room under his very nose . he immediately d35 ] blamed poseidon . now , a god can not usurp another god 's symbol of power directly — that is forbidden by the most ancient of divine laws . but zeus believes your father con- vinced a human hero to take it . '' `` but i did n't — `` '' patience and listen , child , '' chiron said . `` zeus has good reason to be suspicious . the forges of the cyclopes are under the ocean , which gives poseidon some influence over the makers of his brother 's lightning . zeus believes poseidon has taken the master bolt , and is now secretly hav- ing the cyclopes build an arsenal of illegal copies , which might be used to topple zeus from his throne . the only thing zeus was n't sure about was which hero poseidon used to steal the bolt . now poseidon has openly claimed you as his son . you were in newyork over the winter holidays . you could easily have snuck into olympus . zeus believes he has found his thief . '' `` but i 've never even been to olympus ! zeus is crazy ! '' chiron and grover glanced nervously at the sky . the clouds did n't seem to be parting around us , as grover had promised . they were rolling straight over our valley , sealing us in like a coffin lid . `` er , percy ... ? '' grover said . `` we do n't use the c-word to describe the lord of the sky . '' `` perhaps paranoid '' chiron suggested . `` then again , poseidon has tried to unseat zeus before . i believe that was question thirty-eight on your final exam . . . he looked at me as if he actually expected me to remember question thirty-eight . 1136 ] how could anyone accuse me of stealing a god 's weapon ? i could n't even steal a slice of pizza from gabe 's poker party without getting busted . chiron was waiting for an answer . `` something about a golden net ? '' i guessed . `` poseidon and hera and a few other gods . . . they , like , trapped zeus and would n't let him out until he promised to be a better ruler , right ? '' `` correct , '' chiron said . `` and zeus has never trusted poseidon since . of course , poseidon denies stealing the master bolt . he took great offense at the accusation . the two have been arguing back and forth for months , threaten- ing war . and now , you 've come along — the proverbial last straw . '' `` but i 'm just a kid ! `` `` percy , '' grover cut in , `` if you were zeus , and you already thought your brother was plotting to overthrow you , then your brother suddenly admitted he had broken the sacred oath he took after world war ii , that he 's fathered a new mortal hero who might be used as a weapon against you . . . . would n't that put a twist in your toga ? '' `` but i did n't do anything . poseidon — my dad — he did n't really have this master bolt stolen , did he ? '' chiron sighed . `` most thinking observers would agree that thievery is not poseidon 's style . but the sea god is too proud to try convincing zeus of that . zeus has demanded that poseidon return the bolt by the summer solstice . that 's june twenty-first , ten days from now . poseidon wants an apology for being called a thief by the same date . i hoped [ 137 ] that diplomacy might prevail , that hera or demeter or hestia would make the two brothers see sense . but your arrival has inflamed zeus 's temper . now neither god will back down . unless someone intervenes , unless the master bolt is found and returned to zeus before the solstice , there will be war . and do you know what a full-fledged war would look like , percy ? '' `` bad ? '' i guessed . `` imagine the world in chaos . nature at war with itself . olympians forced to choose sides between zeus and poseidon . destruction . carnage . millions dead . western civilization turned into a battleground so big it will make the trojan war look like a water-balloon fight . '' `` bad , '' i repeated . `` and you , percy jackson , would be the first to feel zeus 's wrath . '' it started to rain . volleyball players stopped their game and stared in stunned silence at the sky . i had brought this storm to half-blood hill . zeus was punishing the whole camp because of me . i was furious . `` so i have to find the stupid bolt , '' i said . `` and return it to zeus . '' `` what better peace offering , '' chiron said , `` than to have the son of poseidon return zeus 's property ? '' `` if poseidon does n't have it , where is the thing ? '' `` i believe i know . '' chiron 's expression was grim . `` part of a prophecy i had years ago . . . well , some of the lines make sense to me , now . but before i can say more , you must officially take up the quest . you must seek the counsel of h38 ] counsel of the oracle . '' `` why ca n't you tell me where the bolt is beforehand ? '' `` because if i did . you would be too afraid to accept the challenge. `` i swallowed . `` good reason . '' `` you agree then ? '' i looked at grover , who nodded encouragingly . easy for him . i was the one zeus wanted to kill . `` all right , '' i said . `` it 's better than being turned into a dolphin. `` `` then it 's time you consulted the oracle , '' chiron said . `` go upstairs , percy jackson , to the attic . when you come back down , assuming you 're still sane , we will talk more . '' four flights up , the stairs ended under a green trap- door . i pulled the cord . the door swung down , and a wooden ladder clattered into place . the warm air from above smelled like mildew and rotten wood and something else ... a smell i remembered from biology class . reptiles . the smell of snakes . i held my breath and climbed . the attic was filled with greek hero junk : armor stands covered in cobwebs ; once-bright shields pitted with rust ; old leather steamer trunks plastered with stickers saying ithaka , circe 's isle , and land of the amazons . one long table was stacked with glass jars filled with pickled things — severed hairy claws , huge yellow eyes , various other parts of monsters . a dusty mounted trophy on the wall [ 139 ] looked like a giant snake 's head , but with horns and a full set of shark 's teeth . the plaque read , hydra head # 1 , woodstock . n.y. , 1969. by the window , sitting on a wooden tripod stool , was the most gruesome memento of all : a mummy . not the wrapped-in-cloth kind , but a human female body shriveled to a husk . she wore a tie-dyed sundress , lots of beaded necklaces , and a headband over long black hair . the skin of her face was thin and leathery over her skull , and her eyes were glassy white slits , as if the real eyes had been replaced by marbles ; she 'd been dead a long , long time . looking at her sent chills up my back . and that was before she sat up on her stool and opened her mouth . a green mist poured from the mummy 's mouth , coiling over the floor in thick tendrils , hissing like twenty thousand snakes . i stumbled over myself trying to get to the trap- door , but it slammed shut . inside my head , i heard a voice , slithering into one ear and coiling around my brain : i am the spirit of delphi , speaker of the prophecies of phoebus apollo , shyer of the mighty python . approach , seeker , and ask . i wanted to say , no thanks , wrong door , just looking for the bath- room . but i forced myself to take a deep breath . the mummy was n't alive . she was some kind of grue- some receptacle for something else , the power that was now swirling around me in the green mist . but its presence did n't feel evil , like my demonic math teacher mrs. dodds or the minotaur . it felt more like the three fates i 'd seen knitting the yarn outside the highway fruit stand : ancient , powerful , and definitely not human . but not particularly [ 140 ] interested in killing me , either . i got up the courage to ask , `` what is my destiny ? '' the mist swirled more thickly , collecting right in front of me and around the table with the pickled monster-part jars . suddenly there were four men sitting around the table , playing cards . their faces became clearer . it was smelly gabe and his buddies . my fists clenched , though i knew this poker party could n't be real . it was an illusion , made out of mist . gabe turned toward me and spoke in the rasping voice of the oracle : you shall go west , and face the god who has turned . his buddy on the right looked up and said in the same voice : you shall find what was stolen , and see it safely returned . the guy on the left threw in two poker chips , then said : you shall he betrayed by one who calls you a friend . finally , eddie , our building super , delivered the worst line of all : and you shall fail to save what matters most , in the end . the figures began to dissolve . at first i was too stunned to say anything , but as the mist retreated , coiling into a huge green serpent and slithering back into the mouth of the mummy , i cried , `` wait ! what do you mean ? what friend ? what will i fail to save ? '' the tail of the mist snake disappeared into the mummy 's mouth . she reclined back against the wall . her mouth closed tight , as if it had n't been open in a hundred years . the attic was silent again , abandoned , nothing but a room full of mementos . i got the feeling that i could stand here until i had cob- webs , too , and i would n't learn anything else . [ 141 ] my audience with the oracle was over . `` well ? '' chiron asked me . i slumped into a chair at the pinochle table . `` she said i would retrieve what was stolen . '' grover sat forward , chewing excitedly on the remains of a diet coke can . `` that 's great ! '' `` what did the oracle say exactly ? '' chiron pressed . `` this is important . '' my ears were still tingling from the reptilian voice . `` she . . . she said i would go west and face a god who had turned . i would retrieve what was stolen and see it safely returned . '' `` i knew it , '' grover said . chiron did n't look satisfied . `` anything else ? '' i did n't want to tell him . what friend would betray me ? i did n't have that many . and the last line — i would fail to save what mattered most . what kind of oracle would send me on a quest and tell me , oh , by the way , you 'll fail . how could i confess that ? `` no , '' i said . `` that 's about it . '' he studied my face . `` very well , percy . but know this : the oracle 's words often have double meanings . do n't dwell on them too much . the truth is not always clear until events come to pass . '' i got the feeling he knew i was holding back something bad . and he was trying to make me feel better . `` okay , '' i said , anxious to change topics . `` so where do i go ? who 's this god in the west ? '' [ 142 ] '' ah , think , percy , '' chiron said . `` if zeus and poseidon weaken each other in a war , who stands to gain ? '' `` somebody else who wants to take over ? '' i guessed . `` yes , quite . someone who harbors a grudge , who has been unhappy with his lot since the world was divided eons ago , whose kingdom would grow powerful with the deaths of millions . someone who hates his brothers for forcing him into an oath to have no more children , an oath that both of them have now broken . '' i thought about my dreams , the evil voice that had spo- ken from under the ground . `` hades . '' chiron nodded . `` the lord of the dead is the only possibility. `` a scrap of aluminum dribbled out of grover 's mouth . `` whoa , wait . wh-what ? '' `` a fury came after percy , '' chiron reminded him . `` she watched the young man until she was sure of his iden- tity , then tried to kill him . furies obey only one lord : hades. `` `` yes , but — but hades hates all heroes , '' grover pro- tested . `` especially if he has found out percy is a son of poseidon . . . . '' `` a hellhound got into the forest , '' chiron continued . `` those can only be summoned from the fields of pun- ishment , and it had to be summoned by someone within the camp . hades must have a spy here . he must suspect poseidon will try to use percy to clear his name . hades would very much like to kill this young half-blood before he can take on the quest . '' u43 ] '' great , '' i muttered . `` that 's two major gods who want to kill me . '' `` but a quest to . . . '' grover swallowed . `` i mean , could n't the master bolt be in some place like maine ? maine 's very nice this time of year . '' `` hades sent a minion to steal the master bolt , '' chiron insisted . `` he hid it in the underworld , knowing full well that zeus would blame poseidon . i do n't pretend to under- stand the lord of the dead 's motives perfectly , or why he chose this time to start a war , but one thing is certain . percy must go to the underworld , find the master bolt , and reveal the truth . '' a strange fire burned in my stomach . the weirdest thing was : it was n't fear . it was anticipation . the desire for revenge . hades had tried to kill me three times so far , with the fury , the minotaur , and the hellhound . it was his fault my mother had disappeared in a flash of light . now he was trying to frame me and my dad for a theft we had n't committed . i was ready to take him on . besides , if my mother was in the underworld . . . whoa , boy , said the small part of my brain that was still sane . you 're a kid . hades is a god . grover was trembling . he 'd started eating pinochle cards like potato chips . the poor guy needed to complete a quest with me so he could get his searcher 's license , whatever that was , but how could i ask him to do this quest , especially when the oracle said i was destined to fail ? this was suicide . [ 144 ] '' look , if we know it 's hades , '' i told chiron , `` why ca n't we just tell the other gods ? zeus or poseidon could go down to the underworld and bust some heads . '' `` suspecting and knowing are not the same , '' chiron said . `` besides , even if the other gods suspect hades — and i imag- ine poseidon does — they could n't retrieve the bolt them- selves . gods can not cross each other 's territories except by invitation . t h at is another ancient rule . heroes , on the other hand , have certain privileges . they can go anywhere , challenge anyone , as long as they 're bold enough and strong enough to do it . no god can be held responsible for a hero 's actions . why do you think the gods always operate through humans ? '' `` you 're saying i 'm being used . '' `` i 'm saying it 's no accident poseidon has claimed you now . it 's a very risky gamble , but he 's in a desperate situa- tion . he needs you . '' my dad needs me . emotions rolled around inside me like bits of glass in a kaleidoscope . i did n't know whether to feel resentful or grateful or happy or angry . poseidon had ignored me for twelve years . now suddenly he needed me . i looked at chiron . `` you 've known i was poseidon 's son all along , have n't you ? '' `` i had my suspicions . as i said . . . i 've spoken to the oracle , too . '' i got the feeling there was a lot he was n't telling me about his prophecy , but i decided i could n't worry about that right now . after all , i was holding back information too . [ 145 ] '' so let me get this straight , '' i said . `` i 'm supposed go to the underworld and confront the lord of the dead . '' `` check , '' chiron said . `` find the most powerful weapon in the universe . '' `` check. `` `` and get it back to olympus before the summer sol- stice , in ten days . '' `` that 's about right . '' i looked at grover , who gulped down the ace of hearts . `` did i mention that maine is very nice this time of year ? '' he asked weakly . `` you do n't have to go , '' i told him . `` i ca n't ask that of ii you . `` oh . . . '' he shifted his hooves . `` no . . . it 's just that satyrs and underground places . . . well . . . '' he took a deep breath , then stood , brushing the shred- ded cards and aluminum bits off his t-shirt . `` you saved my life , percy . if . . . if you 're serious about wanting me along , i wo n't let you down . '' i felt so relieved i wanted to cry , though i did n't think that would be very heroic . grover was the only friend i 'd ever had for longer than a few months . i was n't sure what good a satyr could do against the forces of the dead , but i felt better knowing he 'd be with me . `` all the way , g-man . '' i turned to chiron . `` so where do we go ? the oracle just said to go west . '' `` the entrance to the underworld is always in the west . it moves from age to age , just like olympus . right now , of course , it 's in america . '' [ 146 ] where ? chiron looked surprised . `` i thought that would be obvious enough . the entrance to the underworld is in los angeles . '' `` oh , '' i said . `` naturally . so we just get on a plane — `` '' no ! '' grover shrieked . `` percy , what are you thinking ? have you ever been on a plane in your life ? '' i shook my head , feeling embarrassed . my mom had never taken me anywhere by plane . shed always said we did n't have the money . besides , her parents had died in a plane crash . `` percy , think , '' chiron said . `` you are the son of the sea god . your father 's bitterest rival is zeus , lord of the sky . your mother knew better than to trust you in an airplane . you would be in zeus 's domain . you would never come down again alive . '' overhead , lightning crackled . thunder boomed . `` okay , '' i said , determined not to look at the storm . `` so , i 'll travel overland . '' `` that 's right , '' chiron said . `` two companions may accompany you . grover is one . the other has already vol- unteered , if you will accept her help . '' `` gee , '' i said , feigning surprise . `` who else would be stupid enough to volunteer for a quest like this ? '' the air shimmered behind chiron . annabeth became visible , stuffing her yankees cap into her back pocket . `` i 've been waiting a long time for a quest , seaweed brain , '' she said . `` athena is no fan of poseidon , but if you 're [ 147 ] going to save the world . i 'm the best person to keep you from messing up . '' `` if you do say so yourself , '' i said . `` i suppose you have a plan , wise girl ? '' her cheeks colored . `` do you want my help or not ? '' the truth was , i did . i needed all the help i could get . `` a trio , '' i said . `` that 'll work . '' `` excellent , '' chiron said . `` this afternoon , we can take you as far as the bus terminal in manhattan . after that , you are on your own . '' lightning flashed . rain poured down on the meadows that were never supposed to have violent weather . `` no time to waste , '' chiron said . `` i think you should all get packing . '' [ 148 ] , 0 l i ruin a p€rf€ctly f qood bus it did n't take me long to pack . i decided to leave the mino- taur horn in my cabin , which left me only an extra change of clothes and a toothbrush to stuff in a backpack grover had found for me . the camp store loaned me one hundred dollars in mor- tal money and twenty golden drachmas . these coins were as big as girl scout cookies and had images of various greek gods stamped on one side and the empire state building on the other . the ancient mortal drachmas had been silver , chiron told us , but olympians never used less than pure gold . chiron said the coins might come in handy for non- mortal transactions — whatever that meant . he gave annabeth and me each a canteen of nectar and a ziploc bag full of ambrosia squares , to be used only in emergencies , if we were seriously hurt . it was god food , chiron reminded us . it would cure us of almost any injury , but it was lethal to mortals . too much of it would make a half-blood very , very feverish . an overdose would burn us up , literally . annabeth was bringing her magic yankees cap , which she told me had been a twelfth-birthday present from her mom . she carried a book on famous classical architecture , written in ancient greek , to read when she got bored , and 1149 ] a long bronze knife , hidden in her shirt sleeve . i was sure the knife would get us busted the first time we went through a metal detector . grover wore his fake feet and his pants to pass as human . he wore a green rasta-style cap , because when it rained his curly hair flattened and you could just see the tips of his horns . his bright orange backpack was full of scrap metal and apples to snack on . in his pocket was a set of reed pipes his daddy goat had carved for him , even though he only knew two songs : mozart 's piano concerto no . 12 and hilary duff 's `` so yesterday , '' both of which sounded pretty bad on reed pipes . we waved good-bye to the other campers , took one last look at the strawberry fields , the ocean , and the big house , then hiked up half-blood hill to the tall pine tree that used to be thalia , daughter of zeus . chiron was waiting for us in his wheelchair . next to him stood the surfer dude i 'd seen when i was recovering in the sick room . according to grover , the guy was the camp 's head of security . he supposedly had eyes all over his body so he could never be surprised . today , though , he was wear- ing a chauffeur 's uniform , so i could only see extra peepers on his hands , face and neck . `` this is argus , '' chiron told me . `` he will drive you into the city , and , er , well , keep an eye on things . '' i heard footsteps behind us . luke came running up the hill , carrying a pair of bas- ketball shoes . `` hey ! '' he panted . `` glad i caught you . '' h50 ] annabeth blushed , the way she always did when luke was around . `` just wanted to say good luck , '' luke told me . `` and i thought . . . um , maybe you could use these . '' he handed me the sneakers , which looked pretty nor- mal . they even smelled kind of normal . luke said , `` maia ! '' white bird 's wings sprouted out of the heels , startling me so much , i dropped them . the shoes flapped around on the ground until the wings folded up and disappeared . `` awesome ! '' grover said . luke smiled . `` those served me well when i was on my quest . gift from dad . of course , i do n't use them much these days . . . . '' his expression turned sad . i did n't know what to say . it was cool enough that luke had come to say good-bye . i 'd been afraid he might resent me for getting so much attention the last few days . but here he was giving me a magic gift . ... it made me blush almost as much as annabeth . `` hey , man , '' i said . `` thanks . '' `` listen . percy . . . '' luke looked uncomfortable . `` a lot of hopes are riding on you . so just . . . kill some monsters for me , okay ? '' we shook hands . luke patted grover 's head between his horns , then gave a good-bye hug to annabeth . who looked like she might pass out . after luke was gone , i told her , `` you 're hyperventi- lating . '' `` am not . '' h51 ] '' you let him capture the flag instead of you , did n't you ? '' `` oh . . . why do i want to go anywhere with you , percy ? '' she stomped down the other side of the hill , where a white suv waited on the shoulder of the road . argus fol- lowed , jingling his car keys . i picked up the flying shoes and had a sudden bad feeling . i looked at chiron . `` i wo n't be able to use these , will i ? '' he shook his head . `` luke meant well , percy . but taking to the air . . . that would not be wise for you . '' i nodded , disappointed , but then i got an idea . `` hey , grover . you want a magic item ? '' his eyes lit up . `` me ? '' pretty soon we 'd laced the sneakers over his fake feet , and the world 's first flying goat boy was ready for launch . `` maia ! '' he shouted . he got off the ground okay , but then fell over sideways so his backpack dragged through the grass . the winged shoes kept bucking up and down like tiny broncos . `` practice , '' chiron called after him . `` you just need practice ! `` `` aaaaa ! '' grover went flying sideways down the hill like a possessed lawn mower , heading toward the van . before i could follow , chiron caught my arm . `` i should have trained you better , percy , '' he said . `` if only i had more time . hercules , jason — they all got more training . '' `` that 's okay . i just wish — `` i stopped myself because i was about to sound like a u52 ] brat . i was wishing my dad had given me a cool magic item to help on the quest , something as good as luke 's flying shoes , or annabeth 's invisible cap . `` what am i thinking ? '' chiron cried . `` i ca n't let you get away without this . '' he pulled a pen from his coat pocket and handed it to me . it was an ordinary disposable ballpoint , black ink , removable cap . probably cost thirty cents . `` gee , '' i said . `` thanks . '' `` percy , that 's a gift from your father . i 've kept it for years , not knowing you were who i was waiting for . but the prophecy is clear to me now . you are the one . '' i remembered the field trip to the metropolitan museum of art , when i 'd vaporized mrs. dodds . chiron had thrown me a pen that turned into a sword . could this be ... ? i took off the cap , and the pen grew longer and heavier in my hand . in half a second , i held a shimmering bronze sword with a double-edged blade , a leather- wrapped grip , and a flat hilt riveted with gold studs . it was the first weapon that actually felt balanced in my hand . `` the sword has a long and tragic history that we need not go into , '' chiron told me . `` its name is anaklusmos . '' `` 'riptide , ' '' i translated , surprised the ancient greek came so easily . `` use it only for emergencies , '' chiron said , `` and only against monsters . no hero should harm mortals unless absolutely necessary , of course , but this sword would n't harm them in any case . '' h53 ] i looked at the wickedly sharp blade . `` what do you mean it would n't harm mortals ? how could it not ? '' `` the sword is celestial bronze . forged by the cyclopes , tempered in the heart of mount etna , cooled in the river lethe . it 's deadly to monsters , to any creature from the underworld , provided they do n't kill you first . but the blade will pass through mortals like an illusion . they simply are not important enough for the blade to kill . and i should warn you : as a demigod , you can be killed by either celestial or normal weapons . you are twice as vulnerable . '' `` good to know . '' `` now recap the pen . '' i touched the pen cap to the sword tip and instantly riptide shrank to a ballpoint pen again . i tucked it in my pocket , a little nervous , because i was famous for losing pens at school . `` you ca n't , '' chiron said . `` ca n't what ? '' `` lose the pen , '' he said . `` it is enchanted . it will always reappear in your pocket . try it . '' i was wary , but i threw the pen as far as i could down the hill and watched it disappear in the grass . `` it may take a few moments , '' chiron told me . `` now check your pocket . '' sure enough , the pen was there . `` okay , that 's extremely cool , '' i admitted . `` but what if a mortal sees me pulling out a sword ? '' chiron smiled . `` mist is a powerful thing , percy . '' `` mist ? '' [ 154 ] '' yes . read the iliad . it 's full of references to the stuff . whenever divine or monstrous elements mix with the mor- tal world , they generate mist , which obscures the vision of humans . you will see things just as they are , being a half- blood , but humans will interpret things quite differently . remarkable , really , the lengths to which humans will go to fit things into their version of reality . '' i put riptide back in my pocket . for the first time , the quest felt real . i was actually leav- ing half-blood hill . i was heading west with no adult supervision , no backup plan , not even a cell phone . ( chiron said cell phones were traceable by monsters ; if we used one , it would be worse than sending up a flare . ) i had no weapon stronger than a sword to fight off monsters and reach the land of the dead . `` chiron ... '' i said . `` when you say the gods are immor- tal ... i mean , there was a time before them , right ? '' `` four ages before them , actually . the time of the titans was the fourth age , sometimes called the golden age , which is definitely a misnomer . this , the time of western civilization and the rule of zeus , is the fifth age . '' `` so what was it like . . . before the gods ? '' chiron pursed his lips . `` even i am not old enough to remember that , child , but i know it was a time of darkness and savagery for mortals . kronos , the lord of the titans , called his reign the golden age because men lived innocent and free of all knowledge . but that was mere propaganda . the titan king cared nothing for your kind except as appe- tizers or a source of cheap entertainment . it was only in the h55 ] early reign of lord zeus , when prometheus the good titan brought fire to mankind , that your species began to progress , and even then prometheus was branded a radical thinker . zeus punished him severely , as you may recall . of course , eventually the gods warmed to humans , andwestern civilization was born . '' `` but the gods ca n't die now , right ? i mean , as long as western civilization is alive , they 're alive . so . . . even if i failed , nothing could happen so bad it would mess up every- thing , right ? '' chiron gave me a melancholy smile . `` no one knows how long the age of the west will last , percy . the gods are immortal , yes . but then , so were the titans . they still exist , locked away in their various prisons , forced to endure end- less pain and punishment , reduced in power , but still very much alive . may the fates forbid that the gods should ever suffer such a doom , or that we should ever return to the darkness and chaos of the past . all we can do , child , is fol- low our destiny . '' `` our destiny . . . assuming we know what that is . '' `` relax , '' chiron told me . `` keep a clear head . and remember , you may be about to prevent the biggest war in human history . '' `` relax , '' i said . `` i 'm very relaxed . '' when i got to the bottom of the hill , i looked back . under the pine tree that used to be thalia , daughter of zeus , chiron was now standing in full horse-man form , holding his bow high in salute . just your typical summer- camp send-off by your typical centaur . 056 ] argus drove us out of the countryside and into western long island . it felt weird to be on a highway again , annabeth and grover sitting next to me as if we were nor- mal carpoolers . after two weeks at half-blood hill , the real world seemed like a fantasy . i found myself staring at every mcdonald 's , every kid in the back of his parents ' car , every billboard and shopping mall . `` so far so good , '' i told annabeth . `` ten miles and not a single monster . '' she gave me an irritated look . `` it 's bad luck to talk that way , seaweed brain . '' `` remind me again — why do you hate me so much ? '' `` i do n't hate you . '' `` could 've fooled me . '' she folded her cap of invisibility . `` look . . . we 're just not supposed to get along , okay ? our parents are rivals . '' `` why ? '' she sighed . `` how many reasons do you want ? one time my mom caught poseidon with his girlfriend in athena 's temple , which is hugely disrespectful . another time , athena and poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of athens . your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift . my mom created the olive tree . the people saw that her gift was better , so they named the city after her . '' `` they must really like olives . '' `` oh , forget it . '' `` now , if she 'd invented pizza — that i could understand . '' `` i said , forget it ! '' [ 157 ] in the front seat , argus smiled . he did n't say anything , but one blue eye on the back of his neck winked at me . traffic slowed us down in queens . by the time we got into manhattan it was sunset and starting to rain . argus dropped us at the greyhound station on the upper east side , not far from my mom and gabe 's apart- ment . taped to a mailbox was a soggy flyer with my picture on it : have you seen this boy ? i ripped it down before annabeth and grover could notice . argus unloaded our bags , made sure we got our bus tickets , then drove away , the eye on the back of his hand opening to watch us as he pulled out of the parking lot . i thought about how close i was to my old apartment . on a normal day , my mom would be home from the candy store by now . smelly gabe was probably up there right now , playing poker , not even missing her . grover shouldered his backpack . he gazed down the street in the direction i was looking . `` you want to know why she married him , percy ? '' i stared at him . `` were you reading my mind or some- thing ? '' `` just your emotions . '' he shrugged . `` guess i forgot to tell you satyrs can do that . you were thinking about your mom and your stepdad , right ? '' i nodded , wondering what else grover might 've forgot- ten to tell me . `` your mom married gabe for you '' grover told me . `` you call him 'smelly , ' but you 've got no idea . the guy has [ 158 ] this aura . . . . yuck . i can smell him from here . i can smell traces of him on you , and you have n't been near him for a week . '' `` thanks , '' i said . `` where 's the nearest shower ? '' `` you should be grateful . percy . your stepfather smells so repulsively human he could mask the presence of any demigod . as soon as i took a whiff inside his camaro , i knew : gabe has been covering your scent for years . if you had n't lived with him every summer , you probably would 've been found by monsters a long time ago . your mom stayed with him to protect you . she was a smart lady . she must 've loved you a lot to put up with that guy — if that makes you feel any better . '' it did n't , but i forced myself not to show it . i 'll see her again , i thought . she is n't gone . i wondered if grover could still read my emotions , mixed up as they were . i was glad he and annabeth were with me , but i felt guilty that i had n't been straight with them . i had n't told them the real reason i 'd said yes to this crazy quest . the truth was , i did n't care about retrieving zeus 's lightning bolt , or saving the world , or even helping my father out of trouble . the more i thought about it , i resented poseidon for never visiting me , never helping my mom , never even sending a lousy child-support check . he 'd only claimed me because he needed a job done . all i cared about was my mom . hades had taken her unfairly , and hades was going to give her back . you will be betrayed by one who calls you a friend , the oracle [ 159 ] whispered in my mind . you will fail to save what matters most in the end . shut up , i told it . the rain kept coming down . we got restless waiting for the bus and decided to play some hacky sack with one of grover 's apples . annabeth was unbelievable . she could bounce the apple off her knee , her elbow , her shoulder , whatever . i was n't too bad myself . the game ended when i tossed the apple toward grover and it got too close to his mouth . in one mega goat bite , our hacky sack disappeared — core , stem , and all . grover blushed . he tried to apologize , but annabeth and i were too busy cracking up . finally the bus came . as we stood in line to board , grover started looking around , sniffing the air like he smelled his favorite school cafeteria delicacy — enchiladas . `` what is it ? '' i asked . `` i do n't know , '' he said tensely . `` maybe it 's nothing . '' but i could tell it was n't nothing . i started looking over my shoulder , too . i was relieved when we finally got on board and found seats together in the back of the bus . we stowed our back- packs . annabeth kept slapping her yankees cap nervously against her thigh . as the last passengers got on . annabeth clamped her hand onto my knee . `` percy . '' an old lady had just boarded the bus . she wore a crum- pled velvet dress , lace gloves , and a shapeless orange-knit hat [ 160 ] that shadowed her face , and she carried a big paisley purse . when she tilted her head up , her black eyes glittered , and my heart skipped a beat . it was mrs. dodds . older , more withered , but defin- itely the same evil face . i scrunched down in my seat . behind her came two more old ladies : one in a green hat , one in a purple hat . otherwise they looked exactly like mrs. dodds — same gnarled hands , paisley handbags , wrinkled velvet dresses . triplet demon grandmothers . they sat in the front row , right behind the driver . the two on the aisle crossed their legs over the walkway , making an x. it was casual enough , but it sent a clear message : nobody leaves . the bus pulled out of the station , and we headed through the slick streets of manhattan . `` she did n't stay dead long , '' i said , trying to keep my voice from quivering . `` i thought you said they could be dispelled for a life- time . `` i said if you 're lucky '' annabeth said . `` you 're obvi- ously not . '' `` all three of them , '' grover whimpered . `` di immortelles ! '' `` it 's okay , '' annabeth said , obviously thinking hard . `` the furies . the three worst monsters from the underworld . no problem . no problem . we 'll just slip out the windows . '' `` they do n't open , '' grover moaned . `` a back exit ? '' she suggested . there was n't one . even if there had been , it would n't [ 161 ] have helped . by that time , we were on ninth avenue , head- ing for the lincoln tunnel . `` they wo n't attack us with witnesses around , '' i said . `` will they ? '' `` mortals do n't have good eyes , '' annabeth reminded me . `` their brains can only process what they see through the mist . '' `` they 'll see three old ladies killing us . wo n't they ? '' she thought about it . `` hard to say . but we ca n't count on mortals for help . maybe an emergency exit in the roof ... ? '' we hit the lincoln tunnel , and the bus went dark except for the running lights down the aisle . it was eerily quiet without the sound of the rain . mrs. dodds got up . in a flat voice , as if she 'd rehearsed it , she announced to the whole bus : `` i need to use the rest- room . '' `` so do i , '' said the second sister . `` so do i , '' said the third sister . they all started coming down the aisle . `` i 've got it , '' annabeth said . `` percy , take my hat . '' `` what ? '' `` you 're the one they want . turn invisible and go up the aisle . let them pass you . maybe you can get to the front and get away . '' `` but you guys — `` '' there 's an outside chance they might not notice us , '' annabeth said . `` you 're a son of one of the big three . your smell might be overpowering . '' [ 162 ] '' i ca n't just leave you . '' `` do n't worry about us , '' grover said . `` go ! '' my hands trembled . i felt like a coward , but i took the yankees cap and put it on . when i looked down , my body was n't there anymore . i started creeping up the aisle . i managed to get up ten rows , then duck into an empty seat just as the furies walked past . mrs. dodds stopped , sniffing , and looked straight at me . my heart was pounding . apparently she did n't see anything . she and her sisters kept going . i was free . i made it to the front of the bus . we were almost through the lincoln tunnel now . i was about to press the emergency stop button when i heard hideous wail- ing from the back row . the old ladies were not old ladies anymore . their faces were still the same — i guess those could n't get any uglier — but their bodies had shriveled into leathery brown hag bod- ies with bat 's wings and hands and feet like gargoyle claws . their handbags had turned into fiery whips . the furies surrounded grover and annabeth , lashing their whips , hissing : `` where is it ? where ? '' the other people on the bus were screaming , cowering in their seats . they saw something , all right . `` he 's not here ! '' annabeth yelled . `` he 's gone ! '' the furies raised their whips . annabeth drew her bronze knife . grover grabbed a tin can from his snack bag and prepared to throw it . h63 ] what i did next was so impulsive and dangerous i should 've been named adhd poster child of the year . the bus driver was distracted , trying to see what was going on in his rearview mirror . still invisible , i grabbed the wheel from him and jerked it to the left . everybody howled as they were thrown to the right , and i heard what i hoped was the sound of three furies smashing against the windows . `` hey ! '' the driver yelled . `` hey — whoa ! '' we wrestled for the wheel . the bus slammed against the side of the tunnel , grinding metal , throwing sparks a mile behind us . we careened out of the lincoln tunnel and back into the rainstorm , people and monsters tossed around the bus , cars plowed aside like bowling pins . somehow the driver found an exit . we shot off the highway , through half a dozen traffic lights , and ended up barreling down one of those new jersey rural roads where you ca n't believe there 's so much nothing right across the river from new york . there were woods to our left , the hudson river to our right , and the driver seemed to be veering toward the river . another great idea : i hit the emergency brake . the bus wailed , spun a full circle on the wet asphalt , and crashed into the trees . the emergency lights came on . the door flew open . the bus driver was the first one out , the passengers yelling as they stampeded after him . i stepped into the driver 's seat and let them pass . the furies regained their balance . they lashed their [ 164 ] whips at annabeth while she waved her knife and yelled in ancient greek , telling them to back off . grover threw tin cans . i looked at the open doorway i was free to go , but i could n't leave my friends . i took off the invisible cap . `` hey ! `` the furies turned , baring their yellow fangs at me , and the exit suddenly seemed like an excellent idea . mrs. dodds stalked up the aisle , just as she used to do in class , about to deliver my f — math test . every time she flicked her whip , red flames danced along the barbed leather . her two ugly sisters hopped on top of the seats on either side of her and crawled toward me like huge nasty lizards . `` perseus jackson , '' mrs. dodds said , in an accent that was definitely from somewhere farther south than georgia . `` you have offended the gods . you shall die . '' `` i liked you better as a math teacher , '' i told her . she growled . annabeth and grover moved up behind the furies cau- tiously , looking for an opening . i took the ballpoint pen out of my pocket and un- capped it . riptide elongated into a shimmering double- edged sword . the furies hesitated . mrs. dodds had felt riptides blade before . she obvi- ously did n't like seeing it again . `` submit now , '' she hissed . `` and you will not suffer eternal torment . '' 1165 ] '' nice try , '' i told her . `` percy , look out ! '' annabeth cried . mrs. dodds lashed her whip around my sword hand while the furies on the either side lunged at me . my hand felt like it was wrapped in molten lead , but i managed not to drop riptide . i stuck the fury on the left with its hilt , sending her toppling backward into a seat . i turned and sliced the fury on the right . as soon as the blade connected with her neck , she screamed and exploded into dust . annabeth got mrs. dodds in a wrestler 's hold and yanked her backward while grover ripped the whip out of her hands . `` owl '' he yelled . `` ow ! hot ! hot ! '' the fury i 'd hilt-slammed came at me again , talons ready , but i swung riptide and she broke open like a pinata . mrs. dodds was trying to get annabeth off her back . she kicked , clawed , hissed and bit , but annabeth held on while grover got mrs. dodds 's legs tied up in her own whip . finally they both shoved her backward into the aisle . mrs. dodds tried to get up , but she did n't have room to flap her bat wings , so she kept falling down . `` zeus will destroy you ! '' she promised . `` hades will have your soul ! '' `` braceas meas vescimini ! '' i yelled . i was n't sure where the latin came from . i think it meant `` eat my pants ! '' thunder shook the bus . the hair rose on the back of my neck . [ 166 ] '' get out ! '' annabeth yelled at me . `` now ! '' i did n't need any encouragement . we rushed outside and found the other passengers wan- dering around in a daze , arguing with the driver , or running around in circles yelling , `` we 're going to die ! '' a hawaiian- shirted tourist with a camera snapped my photograph before i could recap my sword . `` our bags ! '' grover realized . `` we left our — `` booooom ! the windows of the bus exploded as the passengers ran for cover . lightning shredded a huge crater in the roof , but an angry wail from inside told me mrs. dodds was not yet dead . `` run ! '' annabeth said . `` she 's calling for reinforce- ments ! we have to get out of here ! '' we plunged into the woods as the rain poured down , the bus in flames behind us , and nothing but darkness ahead . h6v ] j , i w€ visit th€ qard€n 7 qnom€ emporium in a way , it 's nice to know there are greek gods out there , because you have somebody to blame when things go wrong . for instance , when you 're walking away from a bus that 's just been attacked by monster hags and blown up by lightning , and it 's raining on top of everything else , most people might think that 's just really bad luck ; when you 're a half-blood , you understand that some divine force really is trying to mess up your day . so there we were , annabeth and grover and i , walking through the woods along the new jersey riverbank , the glow of new york city making the night sky yellow behind us , and the smell of the hudson reeking in our noses . grover was shivering and braying , his big goat eyes turned slit-pupiled and full of terror . `` three kindly ones . all three at once . '' i was pretty much in shock myself . the explosion of bus windows still rang in my ears . but annabeth kept pulling us along , saying : `` come on ! the farther away we get , the better . '' `` all our money was back there , '' i reminded her . `` our food and clothes . everything . '' `` well , maybe if you had n't decided to jump into the fight- '' [ 168 ] '' what did you want me to do ? let you get killed ? '' `` you did n't need to protect me , percy . i would 've been fine . '' `` sliced like sandwich bread . '' grover put in , `` but fine . '' `` shut up , goat boy , '' said annabeth . grover brayed mournfully . `` tin cans ... a perfectly good bag of tin cans . '' we sloshed across mushy ground , through nasty twisted trees that smelled like sour laundry . after a few minutes , annabeth fell into line next to me . `` look , i . . . '' her voice faltered . `` i appreciate your coming back for us , okay ? that was really brave . '' `` we 're a team , right ? '' she was silent for a few more steps . `` it 's just that if you died . . . aside from the fact that it would really suck for you , it would mean the quest was over . this may be my only chance to see the real world . '' the thunderstorm had finally let up . the city glow faded behind us , leaving us in almost total darkness . i could n't see anything of annabeth except a glint of her blond hair . `` you have n't left camp half-blood since you were seven ? '' i asked her . `` no . . . only short field trips . my dad — `` '' the history professor . '' `` yeah . it did n't work out for me living at home . i mean , camp half-blood is my home . '' she was rushing her words out now , as if she were afraid somebody might try to stop her . `` at camp you train and train . and that 's all cool 1169 ] and everything , but the real world is where the monsters are . that 's where you learn whether you 're any good or not . '' if i did n't know better , i could 've sworn i heard doubt in her voice . `` you 're pretty good with that knife , '' i said . `` you think so ? '' `` anybody who can piggyback-ride a fury is okay by me . '' i could n't really see , but i thought she might 've smiled . `` you know , '' she said , `` maybe i should tell you . . . something funny back on the bus . . whatever she wanted to say was interrupted by a shrill toot-toot-toot , like the sound of an owl being tortured . `` hey , my reed pipes still work ! '' grover cried . `` if i could just remember a 'find path ' song , we could get out of these woods ! '' he puffed out a few notes , but the tune still sounded suspiciously like hilary duff . instead of finding a path , i immediately slammed into a tree and got a nice-size knot on my head . add to the list of superpowers i did not have : infrared vision . after tripping and cursing and generally feeling miser- able for another mile or so , i started to see light up ahead : the colors of a neon sign . i could smell food . fried , greasy , excellent food . i realized i had n't eaten anything unhealthy since i 'd arrived at half-blood hill , where we lived on [ 170 ] grapes , bread , cheese , and extra-lean-cut nymph -prepared barbecue . this boy needed a double cheeseburger . we kept walking until i saw a deserted two-lane road through the trees . on the other side was a closed-down gas station , a tattered billboard for a 1990s movie , and one open business , which was the source of the neon light and the good smell . it was n't a fast-food restaurant like i 'd hoped . it was one of those weird roadside curio shops that sell lawn flamin- gos and wooden indians and cement grizzly bears and stuff like that . the main building was a long , low warehouse , sur- rounded by acres of statuary . the neon sign above the gate was impossible for me to read , because if there 's anything worse for my dyslexia than regular english , it 's red cursive neon english . to me , it looked like : atnyu mes gderan gomen meprouim . `` what the heck does that say ? '' i asked . `` i do n't know , '' annabeth said . she loved reading so much , i 'd forgotten she was dyslexic , too . grover translated : `` aunty em 's garden gnome emporium. `` flanking the entrance , as advertised , were two cement garden gnomes , ugly bearded little runts , smiling and wav- ing , as if they were about to get their picture taken . i crossed the street , following the smell of the ham- burgers . `` hey . . . '' grover warned . [ 171 ] '' the lights are on inside , '' annabeth said . `` maybe it 's open. `` `` snack bar , '' i said wistfully . `` snack bar , '' she agreed . `` are you two crazy ? '' grover said . `` this place is weird . '' w e ignored him . the front lot was a forest of statues : cement animals , cement children , even a cement satyr playing the pipes , which gave grover the creeps . `` bla~ha~ha ! '' he bleated . `` looks like my uncle ferdinand ! `` we stopped at the warehouse door . `` do n't knock , '' grover pleaded . `` i smell monsters . '' `` your nose is clogged up from the furies , '' annabeth told him . `` all i smell is burgers . are n't you hungry ? '' `` meat ! '' he said scornfully . `` i 'm a vegetarian . '' `` you eat cheese enchiladas and aluminum cans , '' i reminded him . `` those are vegetables . come on . let 's leave . these stat- ues are . . . looking at me . '' then the door creaked open , and standing in front of us was a tall middle eastern woman — at least , i assumed she was middle eastern , because she wore a long black gown that cov- ered everything but her hands , and her head was completely veiled . her eyes glinted behind a curtain of black gauze , but that was about all i could make out . her coffee-colored hands looked old , but well-manicured and elegant , so i imagined she was a grandmother who had once been a beautiful lady . her accent sounded vaguely middle eastern , too . she [ 172 ] said , `` children , it is too late to be out all alone . where are your parents ? '' `` they 're . . . um . . annabeth started to say . `` we 're orphans , '' i said . `` orphans ? '' the woman said . the word sounded alien in her mouth . `` but , my dears ! surely not ! '' `` we got separated from our caravan , '' i said . `` our cir- cus caravan . the ringmaster told us to meet him at the gas station if we got lost , but he may have forgotten , or maybe he meant a different gas station . anyway , we 're lost . is that food i smell ? '' `` oh , my dears , '' the woman said . `` you must come in , poor children . i am aunty em . go straight through to the back of the warehouse , please . there is a dining area . '' we thanked her and went inside . annabeth muttered to me , `` circus caravan ? '' `` always have a strategy , right ? '' `` your head is full of kelp . '' the warehouse was filled with more statues — people in all different poses , wearing all different outfits and with dif- ferent expressions on their faces . i was thinking you 'd have to have a pretty huge garden to fit even one of these statues , because they were all life-size . but mostly , i was thinking about food . go ahead , call me an idiot for walking into a strange lady 's shop like that just because i was hungry , but i do impulsive stuff sometimes . plus , you 've never smelled aunty em 's burgers . the aroma was like laughing gas in the den- tist 's chair — it made everything else go away . i barely [ 173 ] noticed grover 's nervous whimpers , or the way the statues ' eyes seemed to follow me , or the fact that aunty em had locked the door behind us . all i cared about was finding the dining area . and sure enough , there it was at the back of the warehouse , a fast- food counter with a grill , a soda fountain , a pretzel heater , and a nacho cheese dispenser . everything you could want , plus a few steel picnic tables out front . `` please , sit down , '' aunty em said . `` awesome , '' i said . `` um , '' grover said reluctantly , `` we do n't have any money , ma'am . '' before i could jab him in the ribs , aunty em said , `` no , no , children . no money . this is a special case , yes ? it is my treat , for such nice orphans . '' `` thank you , ma'am , '' annabeth said . aunty em stiffened , as if annabeth had done some- thing wrong , but then the old woman relaxed just as quickly , so i figured it must 've been my imagination . `` quite all right , annabeth , '' she said . `` you have such beautiful gray eyes , child . '' only later did i wonder how she knew annabeth ' s name , even though we had never intro- duced ourselves . our hostess disappeared behind the snack counter and started cooking . before we knew it , she 'd brought us plastic trays heaped with double cheeseburgers , vanilla shakes , and xxl servings of french fries . i was halfway through my burger before i remembered to breathe . [ 174 ] annabeth slurped her shake . grover picked at the fries , and eyed the tray 's waxed paper liner as if he might go for that , but he still looked too nervous to eat . `` what 's that hissing noise ? '' he asked . i listened , but did n't hear anything . annabeth shook her head . `` hissing ? '' aunty em asked . `` perhaps you hear the deep-fryer oil . you have keen ears , grover . '' `` i take vitamins . for my ears . '' `` that 's admirable , '' she said . `` but please , relax . '' aunty em ate nothing . she had n't taken off her head- dress , even to cook , and now she sat forward and interlaced her fingers and watched us eat . it was a little unsettling , hav- ing someone stare at me when i could n't see her face , but i was feeling satisfied after the burger , and a little sleepy , and i figured the least i could do was try to make small talk with our hostess . `` so , you sell gnomes , '' i said , trying to sound interested . `` oh , yes , '' aunty em said . `` and animals . and people . anything for the garden . custom orders . statuary is very popular , you know . '' `` a lot of business on this road ? '' `` not so much . no . since the highway was built ... most cars , they do not go this way now . i must cherish every cus- tomer i get . '' my neck tingled , as if somebody else was looking at me . i turned , but it was just a statue of a young girl holding an easter basket . the detail was incredible , much better than 1175 ] you see in most garden statues . but something was wrong with her face . it looked as if she were startled , or even ter- rified . `` ah , '' aunty em said sadly . `` you notice some of my creations do not turn out well . they are marred . they do not sell . the face is the hardest to get right . always the face . '' `` you make these statues yourself ? '' i asked . `` oh , yes . once upon a time , i had two sisters to help me in the business , but they have passed on , and aunty em is alone . i have only my statues . this is why i make them , you see . they are my company . '' the sadness in her voice sounded so deep and so real that i could n't help feeling sorry for her . annabeth had stopped eating . she sat forward and said , '' two sisters ? '' `` it 's a terrible story , '' aunty em said . `` not one for chil- dren , really . you see , annabeth , a bad woman was jealous of me , long ago , when i was young . i had a ... a boyfriend , you know , and this bad woman was determined to break us apart . she caused a terrible accident . my sisters stayed by me . they shared my bad fortune as long as they could , but eventually they passed on . they faded away . i alone have survived , but at a price . such a price . '' i was n't sure what she meant , but i felt bad for her . my eyelids kept getting heavier , my full stomach making me sleepy . poor old lady . who would want to hurt somebody so nice ? `` percy ? '' annabeth was shaking me to get my attention . [ 176 ] '' maybe we should go . i mean , the ringmaster will be wait- ing . she sounded tense . i was n't sure why . grover was eating the waxed paper off the tray now , but if aunty em found that strange , she did n't say anything . `` such beautiful gray eyes , '' aunty em told annabeth again . `` my , yes , it has been a long time since i 've seen gray eyes like those . '' she reached out as if to stroke annabeth 's cheek , but annabeth stood up abruptly . `` we really should go . '' `` yes ! '' grover swallowed his waxed paper and stood up . `` the ringmaster is waiting ! right ! '' i did n't want to leave . i felt full and content . aunty em was so nice . i wanted to stay with her a while . `` please , dears , '' aunty em pleaded . `` i so rarely get to be with children . before you go , wo n't you at least sit for a pose ? `` a pose ? '' annabeth asked warily . `` a photograph . i will use it to model a new statue set . children are so popular , you see . everyone loves chil- dren . '' annabeth shifted her weight from foot to foot . `` i do n't think we can , ma'am . come on , percy — `` '' sure we can , '' i said . i was irritated with annabeth for being so bossy , so rude to an old lady who 'd just fed us for free . `` it 's just a photo , annabeth . what 's the harm ? '' `` yes , annabeth , '' the woman purred . `` no harm . '' i could tell annabeth did n't like it , but she allowed [ 177 ] aunty em to lead us back out the front door , into the garden of statues . aunty em directed us to a park bench next to the stone satyr . `` now , '' she said , `` i 'll just position you correctly . the young girl in the middle , i think , and the two young gen- tlemen on either side . '' `` not much light for a photo , '' i remarked . `` oh , enough , '' aunty em said . `` enough for us to see each other , yes ? '' `` where 's your camera ? '' grover asked . aunty em stepped back , as if to admire the shot . `` now , the face is the most difficult . can you smile for me please , everyone ? a large smile ? '' grover glanced at the cement satyr next to him , and mumbled , `` that sure does look like uncle ferdinand . '' `` grover , '' aunty em chastised , `` look this way , dear . '' she still had no camera in her hands . `` percy — `` annabeth said . some instinct warned me to listen to annabeth , but i was fighting the sleepy feeling , the comfortable lull that came from the food and the old lady 's voice . `` i will just be a moment , '' aunty em said . `` you know , i ca n't see you very well in this cursed veil . . . . '' `` percy , something 's wrong , '' annabeth insisted . `` wrong ? '' aunty em said , reaching up to undo the wrap around her head . `` not at all , dear . i have such noble company tonight . what could be wrong ? '' `` that is uncle ferdinand ! '' grover gasped . `` look away from her ! '' annabeth shouted . she whipped [ 178 ] her yankees cap onto her head and vanished . her invisible hands pushed grover and me both off the bench . i was on the ground , looking at aunt em 's sandaled feet . i could hear grover scrambling off in one direction , annabeth in another . but i was too dazed to move . then i heard a strange , rasping sound above me . my eyes rose to aunty em 's hands , which had turned gnarled and warty , with sharp bronze talons for fingernails . i almost looked higher , but somewhere off to my left annabeth screamed , `` no ! do n't ! '' more rasping — the sound of tiny snakes , right above me , from . . . from about where aunty em 's head would be . `` run ! '' grover bleated . i heard him racing across the gravel , yelling , `` maia ! '' to kick-start his flying sneakers . i could n't move . i stared at aunty em 's gnarled claws , and tried to fight the groggy trance the old woman had put me in . `` such a pity to destroy a handsome young face , '' she told me soothingly . `` stay with me , percy . all you have to do is look up. `` i fought the urge to obey . instead i looked to one side and saw one of those glass spheres people put in gardens — a gazing ball . i could see aunty em 's dark reflection in the orange glass ; her headdress was gone , revealing her face as a shimmering pale circle . her hair was moving , writhing like serpents . aunty em . aunty `` m. '' 1179 ] how could i have been so stupid ? think , i told myself . how did medusa die in the myth ? but i could n't think . something told me that in the myth medusa had been asleep when she was attacked by my namesake , perseus . she was n't anywhere near asleep now . if she wanted , she could take those talons right now and rake open my face . `` the gray-eyed one did this to me , percy , '' medusa said , and she did n't sound anything like a monster . her voice invited me to look up , to sympathize with a poor old grandmother . `` annabeth 's mother , the cursed athena , turned me from a beautiful woman into this . '' `` do n't listen to her ! '' annabeth 's voice shouted , some- where in the statuary . `` run , percy ! '' `` silence ! '' medusa snarled . then her voice modulated back to a comforting purr . `` you see why i must destroy the girl , percy . she is my enemy 's daughter . i shall crush her statue to dust . but you , dear percy , you need not suffer . '' `` no , '' i muttered . i tried to make my legs move . `` do you really want to help the gods ? '' medusa asked . `` do you understand what awaits you on this foolish quest , percy ? what will happen if you reach the underworld ? do not be a pawn of the olympians , my dear . you would be better off as a statue . less pain . less pain . '' `` percy ! '' behind me , i heard a buzzing sound , like a two- hundred-pound hummingbird in a nosedive . grover yelled , '' duck ! `` i turned , and there he was in the night sky , flying in from twelve o'clock with his winged shoes fluttering , [ 180 ] grover , holding a tree branch the size of a baseball bat . his eyes were shut tight , his head twitched from side to side . he was navigating by ears and nose alone . `` duck ! '' he yelled again . `` i 'll get her ! '' that finally jolted me into action . knowing grover , i was sure he 'd miss medusa and nail me . i dove to one side . thwack ! at first i figured it was the sound of grover hitting a tree . then medusa roared with rage . `` you miserable satyr , '' she snarled . `` i 'll add you to my collection ! `` `` that was for uncle ferdinand ! '' grover yelled back . i scrambled away and hid in the statuary while grover swooped down for another pass . ker~whack ! `` arrgh ! '' medusa yelled , her snake-hair hissing and spit- ting . right next to me , annabeth 's voice said , `` percy ! '' i jumped so high my feet nearly cleared a garden gnome . `` jeez ! do n't do that ! '' annabeth took off her yankees cap and became visible . `` you have to cut her head off . '' `` what ? are you crazy ? let 's get out of here . '' `` medusa is a menace . she 's evil . i 'd kill her myself , but . . . '' annabeth swallowed , as if she were about to make a difficult admission . `` but you 've got the better weapon . besides , i 'd never get close to her . she 'd slice me to bits because of my mother . you — you 've got a chance . '' `` what ? i ca n't — `` u 81 ] '' look , do you want her turning more innocent people into statues ? '' she pointed to a pair of statue lovers , a man and a woman with their arms around each other , turned to stone by the monster . annabeth grabbed a green gazing ball from a nearby pedestal . `` a polished shield would be better . '' she studied the sphere critically . `` the convexity will cause some distor- tion . the reflection 's size should be off by a factor of — `` '' would you speak english ? '' `` i am ! '' she tossed me the glass ball . `` just look at her in the glass . never look at her directly . '' `` hey , guys ! '' grover yelled somewhere above us . `` i think she 's unconscious ! '' `` roooaaarrr ! '' `` maybe not , '' grover corrected . he went in for another pass with the tree branch . `` hurry , '' annabeth told me . `` grover 's got a great nose , but he 'll eventually crash . '' i took out my pen and uncapped it . the bronze blade of riptide elongated in my hand . i followed the hissing and spitting sounds of medusa 's hair . i kept my eyes locked on the gazing ball so i would only glimpse medusa 's reflection , not the real thing . then , in the green tinted glass , i saw her . grover was coming in for another turn at bat , but this time he flew a little too low . medusa grabbed the stick and pulled him off course . he tumbled through the air and [ 182 ] crashed into the arms of a stone grizzly bear with a painful '' ummphh ! `` medusa was about to lunge at him when i yelled , '' hey ! `` i advanced on her , which was n't easy , holding a sword and a glass ball . if she charged . i 'd have a hard time defend- ing myself . but she let me approach — twenty feet , ten feet . i could see the reflection of her face now . surely it was n't really that ugly . the green swirls of the gazing ball must be distorting it , making it look worse . `` you would n't harm an old woman , percy , '' she crooned . `` i know you would n't . '' i hesitated , fascinated by the face i saw reflected in the glass — the eyes that seemed to burn straight through the green tint , making my arms go weak . from the cement grizzly , grover moaned , `` percy , do n't listen to her ! '' medusa cackled . `` too late . '' she lunged at me with her talons . i slashed up with my sword , heard a sickening shlock ! , then a hiss like wind rushing out of a cavern — the sound of a monster disintegrating . something fell to the ground next to my foot . it took all my willpower not to look . i could feel warm ooze soaking into my sock , little dying snake heads tugging at my shoelaces . `` oh , yuck , '' grover said . his eyes were still tightly closed , but i guess he could hear the thing gurgling and steaming . `` mega-yuck . '' 1183 ] annabeth came up next to me . her eyes fixed on the sky . she was holding medusa 's black veil . she said , `` do n't move . '' very , very carefully , without looking down , she knelt and draped the monster 's head in black cloth , then picked it up . it was still dripping green juice . `` are you okay ? '' she asked me , her voice trembling . `` yeah , '' i decided , though i felt like throwing up my double cheeseburger . `` why did n't . . . why did n't the head evaporate ? '' `` once you sever it , it becomes a spoil of war , '' she said . `` same as your minotaur horn . but do n't unwrap the head . it can still petrify you . '' grover moaned as he climbed down from the grizzly statue . he had a big welt on his forehead . his green rasta cap hung from one of his little goat horns , and his fake feet had been knocked off his hooves . the magic sneakers were flying aimlessly around his head . `` the red baron , '' i said . `` good job , man . '' he managed a bashful grin . `` that really was not fun , though . well , the hitting-her-with-a-stick part , that was fun . but crashing into a concrete bear ? not fun . '' he snatched his shoes out of the air . i recapped my sword . together , the three of us stumbled back to the ware- house . we found some old plastic grocery bags behind the snack counter and double-wrapped medusa 's head . we plopped it on the table where we 'd eaten dinner and sat around it , too exhausted to speak . [ 184 ] finally i said , `` so we have athena to thank for this monster ? '' annabeth flashed me an irritated look . `` your dad , actu- ally . do n't you remember ? medusa was poseidon 's girl- friend . they decided to meet in my mother 's temple . that 's why athena turned her into a monster . medusa and her two sisters who had helped her get into the temple , they became the three gorgons . that 's why medusa wanted to slice me up , but she wanted to preserve you as a nice statue . she 's still sweet on your dad . you probably reminded her of him . '' my face was burning . `` oh , so now it 's my fault we met medusa. `` annabeth straightened . in a bad imitation of my voice , she said : ' '' it 's just a photo , annabeth . what 's the harm ? `` ’ '' forget it , '' i said . `` you 're impossible . '' `` you 're insufferable . '' `` you 're — `` '' fley ! '' grover interrupted . `` you two are giving me a migraine , and satyrs do n't even get migraines . what are we going to do with the head ? '' i stared at the thing . one little snake was hanging out of a hole in the plastic . the words printed on the side of the bag said : we appreciate y o u r business ! i was angry , not just with annabeth or her mom , but with all the gods for this whole quest , for getting us blown off the road and in two major fights the very first day out from camp . at this rate , we 'd never make it to l.a. alive , much less before the summer solstice . what had medusa said ? 085 ] do not be a pawn of the olympians , my dear . you would he better off as a statue . i got up . `` i 'll be back . '' `` percy , '' annabeth called after me . `` what are you — `` i searched the back of the warehouse until i found medusa 's office . her account book showed her six most recent sales , all shipments to the underworld to decorate hades and persephone 's garden . according to one freight bill , the underworld 's billing address was doa recording studios , west hollywood , california . i folded up the bill and stuffed it in my pocket . in the cash register i found twenty dollars , a few golden drachmas , and some packing slips for hermes overnight express , each with a little leather bag attached for coins . i rummaged around the rest of the office until i found the right-size box . i went back to the picnic table , packed up medusa 's head , and filled out a delivery slip : titu & ods moourb olympus floov ' j empivss s+zrhe buiwi/pj ne ’ oo yovi < i ny vjrfu best '' ujisbesj peroy eaokson '' they 're not going to like that , '' grover warned . they 'll think you 're impertinent . '' [ 186 ] i poured some golden drachmas in the pouch . as soon as i closed it , there was a sound like a cash register . the package floated off the table and disappeared with a pop ! `` i am impertinent , '' i said . i looked at annabeth , daring her to criticize . she did n't . she seemed resigned to the fact that i had a major talent for ticking off the gods . `` come on , '' she mut- tered . `` we need a new plan . '' h87 ] i2 l w€ q€t advic6 f fl^om a p00dl€ we were pretty miserable that night . we camped out in the woods , a hundred yards from the main road , in a marshy clearing that local kids had obvi- ously been using for parties . the ground was littered with flattened soda cans and fast-food wrappers . wed taken some food and blankets from aunty em 's , but we did n't dare light a fire to dry our damp clothes . the furies and medusa had provided enough excitement for one day . we did n't want to attract anything else . we decided to sleep in shifts . i volunteered to take first watch . annabeth curled up on the blankets and was snoring as soon as her head hit the ground . grover fluttered with his flying shoes to the lowest bough of a tree , put his back to the trunk , and stared at the night sky . `` go ahead and sleep , '' i told him . `` i 'll wake you if there 's trouble . '' he nodded , but still did n't close his eyes . `` it makes me sad . percy . '' `` what does ? the fact that you signed up for this stu- pid quest ? '' `` no . this makes me sad . '' he pointed at all the garbage [ 188 ] on the ground . `` and the sky . you ca n't even see the stars . they 've polluted the sky . this is a terrible time to be a satyr . '' `` oh , yeah . i guess you 'd be an environmentalist . '' he glared at me . `` only a human would n't be . your species is clogging up the world so fast . . . ah , never mind . it 's useless to lecture a human . at the rate things are going , i 'll never find pan . '' `` pam ? like the cooking spray ? '' `` pan ! '' he cried indignantly . `` p-a-n. the great god pan ! what do you think i want a searcher 's license for ? '' a strange breeze rustled through the clearing , tem- porarily overpowering the stink of trash and muck . it brought the smell of berries and wildflowers and clean rain- water , things that might 've once been in these woods . suddenly i was nostalgic for something i 'd never known . `` tell me about the search , '' i said . grover looked at me cautiously , as if he were afraid i was just making fun . `` the god of wild places disappeared two thousand years ago , '' he told me . `` a sailor off the coast of ephesos heard a mysterious voice crying out from the shore , 'tell them that the great god pan has died ! ' when humans heard the news , they believed it . they 've been pillaging pan 's kingdom ever since . but for the satyrs . pan was our lord and master . he protected us and the wild places of the earth . we refuse to believe that he died . in every generation , the bravest satyrs pledge their lives to finding pan . they search the earth , exploring all the wildest places , hoping to find where he is hidden , and wake him from his sleep . '' [ 189 ] '' and you want to be a searcher . '' `` it 's my life 's dream . '' he said . `` my father was a searcher . and my uncle ferdinand . . . the statue you saw back there — `` '' oh , right , sorry . '' grover shook his head . `` uncle ferdinand knew the risks . so did my dad . but i ’ ll succeed . i 'll be the first searcher to return alive . '' `` hang on — the first ? '' grover took his reed pipes out of his pocket . `` no searcher has ever come back . once they set out , they disap- pear . they 're never seen alive again . '' `` not once in two thousand years ? '' `` no . '' `` and your dad ? you have no idea what happened to him ? '' `` none . '' `` but you still want to go , '' i said , amazed . `` i mean , you really think you 'll be the one to find pan ? '' `` i have to believe that , percy . every searcher does . it 's the only thing that keeps us from despair when we look at what humans have done to the world . i have to believe pan can still be awakened . '' i stared at the orange haze of the sky and tried to understand how grover could pursue a dream that seemed so hopeless . then again , was i any better ? `` how are we going to get into the underworld ? '' i asked him . `` i mean , what chance do we have against a god ? '' `` i do n't know , '' he admitted . `` but back at medusa 's , [ 190 ] when you were searching her office ? annabeth was telling n me — '' oh , i forgot . annabeth will have a plan all figured out . `` do n't be so hard on her , percy . she 's had a tough life , but she 's a good person . after all , she forgave me . . . . '' his voice faltered . `` what do you mean ? '' i asked . `` forgave you for what ? '' suddenly , grover seemed very interested in playing notes on his pipes . `` wait a minute , '' i said . `` your first keeper job was five years ago . annabeth has been at camp five years . she was n't ... i mean , your first assignment that went wrong — `` '' i ca n't talk about it , '' grover said , and his quivering lower lip suggested he 'd start crying if i pressed him . `` but as i was saying , back at medusa 's , annabeth and i agreed there 's something strange going on with this quest . some- thing is n't what it seems . '' `` well , duh . i 'm getting blamed for stealing a thunder- bolt that hades took . '' `` that 's not what i mean , '' grover said . `` the fur — the kindly ones were sort of holding back . like mrs. dodds atyancy academy . . . why did she wait so long to try to kill you ? then on the bus , they just were n't as aggressive as they could 've been . '' `` they seemed plenty aggressive to me . '' grover shook his head . `` they were screeching at us : 'where is it ? where ? '' ' `` asking about me , '' i said . [ 191 ] '' maybe . . . but annabeth and i , we both got the feel- ing they were n't asking about a person . they said 'where is if ? ' they seemed to be asking about an object . '' `` that does n't make sense . '' `` i know . but if we 've misunderstood something about this quest , and we only have nine days to find the master bolt . . . . '' he looked at me like he was hoping for answers , but i did n't have any . i thought about what medusa had said : i was being used by the gods . what lay ahead of me was worse than petrifi- cation . `` i have n't been straight with you , '' i told grover . `` i do n't care about the master bolt . i agreed to go to the underworld so i could bring back my mother . '' grover blew a soft note on his pipes . `` i know that , percy . but are you sure that 's the only reason ? '' `` i 'm not doing it to help my father . he does n't care about me . i do n't care about him . '' grover gazed down from his tree branch . `` look , percy , i 'm not as smart as annabeth . i 'm not as brave as you . but i 'm pretty good at reading emotions . you 're glad your dad is alive . you feel good that he 's claimed you , and part of you wants to make him proud . that 's why you mailed medusa 's head to olympus . you wanted him to notice what you 'd done . `` `` yeah ? well maybe satyr emotions work differently than human emotions . because you 're wrong . i do n't care what he thinks . `` grover pulled his feet up onto the branch . `` okay , percy . whatever. `` 1192 ] '' besides , 1 have n't done anything worth bragging about . we barely got out of new york and we 're stuck here with no money and no way west. ” grover looked at the night sky , like he was thinking about that problem . `` how about z take first watch , huh ? you get some sleep. ” 1 wanted to protest , but he started to play mozart , soft and sweet , and i turned away , my eyes stinging . after a few bars of piano concerto no . 12 , i was asleep . in my dreams , i stood in a dark cavern before a gaping pit . gray mist creatures churned all around me , whispering rags of smoke that i somehow knew were the spirits of the dead . they tugged at my clothes , trying to pull me back , but 1 felt compelled to walk forward to the very edge of the chasm . looking down made me dizzy . the pit yawned so wide and was so completely black , 1 knew it must be bottomless . yet i had a feeling that some- thing was trying to rise from the abyss , something huge and evil . the little hero , an amused voice echoed far down in the darkness . too weak , tooyoung , hut perhaps you will do . the voice felt ancient — cold and heavy . it wrapped around me like sheets of lead . they have misledyou , hoy , it said . barter with me . 1 will give you what you want . a shimmering image hovered over the void : my mother , frozen at the moment she 'd dissolved in a shower of gold . 1193 ] her face was distorted with pain , as if the minotaur were still squeezing her neck . her eyes looked directly at me , pleading : go ! i tried to cry out , but my voice would n't work . cold laughter echoed from the chasm . an invisible force pulled me forward . it would drag me into the pit unless i stood firm . help me rise , boy . the voice became hungrier . bring me the bolt . strike a blow against the treacherous gods ! the spirits of the dead whispered around me , no ! wake ! the image of my mother began to fade . the thing in the pit tightened its unseen grip around me . i realized it was n't interested in pulling me in . it was using me to pull itself out . good , it murmured . good . wake ! the dead whispered . wake ! someone was shaking me . my eyes opened , and it was daylight . `` well , '' annabeth said , `` the zombie lives . '' i was trembling from the dream . i could still feel the grip of the chasm monster around my chest . `` how long was i asleep ? '' `` long enough for me to cook breakfast . '' annabeth tossed me a bag of nacho-flavored corn chips from aunty em 's snack bar . `` and grover went exploring . look , he found a friend . '' my eyes had trouble focusing . grover was sitting cross-legged on a blanket with [ 194 ] something fuzzy in his lap , a dirty , unnaturally pink stuffed animal . no . it was n't a stuffed animal . it was a pink poodle . the poodle yapped at me suspiciously . grover said , '' no . he 's not . '' i blinked . `` are you . . . talking to that thing ? '' the poodle growled . `` this thing '' grover warned , `` is our ticket west . be nice to him . '' `` you can talk to animals ? '' grover ignored the question . `` percy , meet gladiola . gladiola , percy . '' i stared at annabeth , figuring she 'd crack up at this practical joke they were playing on me , but she looked deadly serious . `` i 'm not saying hello to a pink poodle , '' i said . `` for- get it . '' `` percy , '' annabeth said . `` i said hello to the poodle . you say hello to the poodle . '' the poodle growled . i said hello to the poodle . grover explained that he 'd come across gladiola in the woods and they 'd struck up a conversation . the poodle had run away from a rich local family , who 'd posted a $ 200 reward for his return . gladiola did n't really want to go back to his family , but he was willing to if it meant helping grover . `` how does gladiola know about the reward ? '' i asked . `` he read the signs , '' grover said . `` duh . '' [ 195 ] '' of course , '' i said . `` silly me . '' `` so we turn in gladiola , '' annabeth explained in her best strategy voice , `` we get money , and we buy tickets to los angeles . simple . '' i thought about my dream — the whispering voices of the dead , the thing in the chasm , and my mother 's face , shimmering as it dissolved into gold . all that might be wait- ing for me in the west . `` not another bus , '' i said warily . `` no , '' annabeth agreed . she pointed downhill , toward train tracks i had n't been able to see last night in the dark . `` there 's an amtrack sta- tion half a mile that way . according to gladiola , the west- bound train leaves at noon . '' [ 196 ] 13 ♦ i plunq€ to my d€ath we spent two days on the amtrak train , heading west through hills , over rivers , past amber waves of grain . we were n't attacked once , but i did n't relax . i felt that we were traveling around in a display case , being watched from above and maybe from below , that something was waiting for the right opportunity . i tried to keep a low profile because my name and pic- ture were splattered over the front pages of several east coast newspapers . the trenton register-news showed a photo taken by a tourist as i got off the greyhound bus . i had a wild look in my eyes . my sword was a metallic blur in my hands . it might 've been a baseball bat or a lacrosse stick . the picture 's caption read : twelve-year-old percy jackson , wanted for questioning in the long island disappearance of his mother two weeks ago , is shown here fleeing from the bus where he accosted several elderly female passengers . the bus exploded on an east new jersey roadside shortly after jackson fled the scene . based on eyewitness accounts , police believe the boy may be traveling with two teenage accomplices . his stepfather , gabe ugliano , has offered a cash reward for information leading to his capture . [ 197 ] '' do n't worry , '' annabeth told me . `` mortal police could never find us . '' but she did n't sound so sure . the rest of the day i spent alternately pacing the length of the train ( because i had a really hard time sitting still ) or looking out the windows . once , i spotted a family of centaurs galloping across a wheat field , bows at the ready , as they hunted lunch . the lit- tle boy centaur , who was the size of a second-grader on a pony , caught my eye and waved . i looked around the pas- senger car , but nobody else had noticed . the adult riders all had their faces buried in laptop computers or magazines . another time , toward evening , i saw something huge moving through the woods . i could 've sworn it was a lion , except that lions do n't live wild in america , and this thing was the size of a hummer . its fur glinted gold in the evening light . then it leaped through the trees and was gone . our reward money for returning gladiola the poodle had only been enough to purchase tickets as far as denver . we could n't get berths in the sleeper car , so we dozed in our seats . my neck got stiff . i tried not to drool in my sleep , since annabeth was sitting right next to me . grover kept snoring and bleating and waking me up . once , he shuffled around and his fake foot fell off . annabeth and i had to stick it back on before any of the other passengers noticed . `` so , '' annabeth asked me , once we 'd gotten grover 's sneaker readjusted . `` who wants your help ? '' `` what do you mean ? '' [ 198 ] '' when you were asleep just now , you mumbled , `` 1 wo n't help you . ' who were you dreaming about ? '' i was reluctant to say anything . it was the second time i 'd dreamed about the evil voice from the pit . but it both- ered me so much i finally told her . annabeth was quiet for a long time . `` that does n't sound like hades . he always appears on a black throne , and he never laughs . '' `` he offered my mother in trade . who else could do that ? '' `` i guess ... if he meant , 'help me rise from the underworld . ' if he wants war with the olympians . but why ask you to bring him the master bolt if he already has it ? '' i shook my head , wishing 1 knew the answer . i thought about what grover had told me , that the furies on the bus seemed to have been looking for something . where is it ? where ? maybe grover sensed my emotions . he snorted in his sleep , muttered something about vegetables , and turned his head . annabeth readjusted his cap so it covered his horns . `` percy , you ca n't barter with hades . you know that , right ? he 's deceitful , heartless , and greedy . 1 do n't care if his kindly ones weren ’ t as aggressive this time — `` '' this time ? '' i asked . `` you mean you 've run into them before ? '' her hand crept up to her necklace . she fingered a glazed white bead painted with the image of a pine tree , one of her clay end-of-summer tokens . `` let 's just say i ’ ve got no love [ 199 ] for the lord of the dead . you ca n't be tempted to make a deal for your mom . '' `` what would you do if it was your dad ? '' `` that 's easy , '' she said . `` i 'd leave him to rot . '' `` you 're not serious ? '' annabeth 's gray eyes fixed on me . she wore the same expression she 'd worn in the woods at camp , the moment she drew her sword against the hellhound . `` my dad 's resented me since the day i was born . percy , '' she said . `` he never wanted a baby . when he got me . he asked athena to take me back and raise me on olympus because he was too busy with his work . she was n't happy about that . she told him heroes had to be raised by their mortal parent . '' `` but how ... i mean , i guess you were n't born in a hos- pital . . . . '' `` i appeared on my father 's doorstep , in a golden cradle , carried down from olympus by zephyr the west wind . you 'd think my dad would remember that as a miracle , right ? like , maybe he 'd take some digital photos or some- thing . but he always talked about my arrival as if it were the most inconvenient thing that had ever happened to him . when i was five he got married and totally forgot about athena . he got a 'regular ' mortal wife , and had two 'regu- lar ' mortal kids , and tried to pretend i did n't exist . '' i stared out the train window . the lights of a sleeping town were drifting by . i wanted to make annabeth feel bet- ter , but i did n't know how . `` my mom married a really awful guy , '' i told her . `` grover said she did it to protect me , to hide me in the [ 200 ] scent of a human family . maybe that 's what your dad was thinking . '' annabeth kept worrying at her necklace . she was pinch- ing the gold college ring that hung with the beads . it occurred to me that the ring must be her father 's . i won- dered why she wore it if she hated him so much . `` he does n't care about me , '' she said . `` his wife — my stepmom — treated me like a freak . she would n't let me play with her children . my dad went along with her . whenever something dangerous happened — you know , something with monsters — they would both look at me resentfully , like , 'how dare you put our family at risk . ' finally , i took the hint . i was n't wanted . i ran away . '' `` how old were you ? '' `` same age as when i started camp . seven . '' `` but . . . you could n't have gotten all the way to half- blood hill by yourself . '' `` not alone , no . athena watched over me , guided me toward help . i made a couple of unexpected friends who took care of me , for a short time , anyway . '' i wanted to ask what happened , but annabeth seemed lost in sad memories . so i listened to the sound of grover snoring and gazed out the train windows as the dark fields of ohio raced by . toward the end of our second day on the train , june 13 , eight days before the summer solstice , we passed through some golden hills and over the mississippi river into st. louis . [ 201 ] annabeth craned her neck to see the gateway arch , which looked to me like a huge shopping bag handle stuck on the city . `` i want to do that , '' she sighed . `` what ? '' i asked . `` build something like that . you ever see the parthenon , percy ? '' `` only in pictures . '' `` someday , i 'm going to see it in person . i 'm going to build the greatest monument to the gods , ever . something that 'll last a thousand years . '' i laughed . `` you ? an architect ? '' i do n't know why , but i found it funny . just the idea of annabeth trying to sit quietly and draw all day . her cheeks flushed . `` yes , an architect . athena expects her children to create things , not just tear them down , like a certain god of earthquakes i could mention . '' i watched the churning brown water of the mississippi below . `` sorry , '' annabeth said . `` that was mean . '' `` ca n't we work together a little ? '' i pleaded . `` i mean , did n't athena and poseidon ever cooperate ? '' annabeth had to think about it . `` i guess . . . the char- iot , '' she said tentatively . `` my mom invented it , but poseidon created horses out of the crests of waves . so they had to work together to make it complete . '' `` then we can cooperate , too . right ? '' we rode into the city , annabeth watching as the arch disappeared behind a hotel . [ 202 ] '' i suppose , '' she said at last . we pulled into the amtrak station downtown . the intercom told us we 'd have a three-hour layover before departing for denver . grover stretched . before he was even fully awake , he said . `` food . '' `` come on , goat boy , '' annabeth said . `` sightseeing . '' `` sightseeing ? '' `` the gateway arch , '' she said . `` this may be my only chance to ride to the top . are you coming or not ? '' grover and i exchanged looks . i wanted to say no , but i figured that if annabeth was going , we could n't very well let her go alone . grover shrugged . `` as long as there 's a snack bar with- out monsters . '' the arch was about a mile from the train station . late in the day the lines to get in were n't that long . we threaded our way through the underground museum , looking at covered wagons and other junk from the 1800s . it was n't all that thrilling , but annabeth kept telling us interesting facts about how the arch was built , and grover kept passing me jelly beans , so i was okay . i kept looking around , though , at the other people in line . `` you smell anything ? '' i murmured to grover . he took his nose out of the jelly-bean bag long enough to sniff . `` underground , '' he said distastefully . `` under- ground air always smells like monsters . probably does n't mean anything . '' [ 203 ] but something felt wrong to me . i had a feeling we should n't be here . `` guys , '' i said . `` you know the gods ' symbols of power ? '' annabeth had been in the middle of reading about the construction equipment used to build the arch , but she looked over . `` yeah ? '' `` well , hade — `` grover cleared his throat . `` we 're in a public place . . . . you mean , our friend downstairs ? '' `` um , right , '' i said . `` our friend way downstairs . does n't he have a hat like annabeth 's ? '' `` you mean the helm of darkness , '' annabeth said . `` yeah , that 's his symbol of power . i saw it next to his seat during the winter solstice council meeting . '' `` he was there ? '' i asked . she nodded . `` it 's the only time he 's allowed to visit olympus — the darkest day of the year . but his helm is a lot more powerful than my invisibility hat , if what i 've heard is true . . . . `` it allows him to become darkness , '' grover confirmed . `` he can melt into shadow or pass through walls . he ca n't be touched , or seen , or heard . and he can radiate fear so intense it can drive you insane or stop your heart . why do you think all rational creatures fear the dark ? '' `` but then . . . how do we know he 's not here right now , watching us ? '' i asked . annabeth and grover exchanged looks . `` we do n't , '' grover said . [ 204 ] '' thanks , that makes me feel a lot better , '' i said . `` got any blue jelly beans left ? '' id almost mastered my jumpy nerves when i saw the tiny little elevator car we were going to ride to the top of the arch , and i knew i was in trouble . i hate confined places . they make me nuts . we got shoehorned into the car with this big fat lady and her dog , a chihuahua with a rhinestone collar . i figured maybe the dog was a seeing-eye chihuahua , because none of the guards said a word about it . we started going up , inside the arch . id never been in an elevator that went in a curve , and my stomach was n't too happy about it . `` no parents ? '' the fat lady asked us . she had beady eyes ; pointy , coffee-stained teeth ; a floppy denim hat , and a denim dress that bulged so much , she looked like a blue-jean blimp . `` they 're below , '' annabeth told her . `` scared of heights . '' `` oh , the poor darlings . '' the chihuahua growled . the woman said , `` now , now , sonny . behave . '' the dog had beady eyes like its owner , intelligent and vicious . i said , `` sonny . is that his name ? '' `` no , '' the lady told me . she smiled , as if that cleared everything up . at the top of the arch , the observation deck reminded me of a tin can with carpeting . rows of tiny windows looked out over the city on one side and the river on the [ 205 ] other . the view was okay , but if there 's anything i like less than a confined space , it 's a confined space six hundred feet in the air . i was ready to go pretty quick . annabeth kept talking about structural supports , and how she would 've made the windows bigger , and designed a see-through floor . she probably could 've stayed up there for hours , but luckily for me the park ranger announced that the observation deck would be closing in a few minutes . i steered grover and annabeth toward the exit , loaded them into the elevator , and i was about to get in myself when i realized there were already two other tourists inside . no room for me . the park ranger said , `` next car , sir . '' `` we 'll get out , '' annabeth said . `` we 'll wait with you . '' but that was going to mess everybody up and take even more time , so i said , `` naw , it 's okay . i 'll see you guys at the bottom . '' grover and annabeth both looked nervous , but they let the elevator door slide shut . their car disappeared down the ramp . now the only people left on the observation deck were me , a little boy with his parents , the park ranger , and the fat lady with her chihuahua . i smiled uneasily at the fat lady . she smiled back , her forked tongue flickering between her teeth . wait a minute . forked tongue ? before i could decide if i 'd really seen that , her chihuahua jumped down and started yapping at me . [ 206 ] '' now , now , sonny , '' the lady said . `` does this look like a good time ? we have all these nice people here . '' `` doggie ! '' said the little boy . `` look , a doggie ! '' his parents pulled him back . the chihuahua bared his teeth at me , foam dripping from his black lips . `` well , son , '' the fat lady sighed . `` if you insist . '' ice started forming in my stomach . `` um , did you just call that chihuahua your son ? '' `` chimera , dear , '' the fat lady corrected . `` not a chihuahua . it 's an easy mistake to make . '' she rolled up her denim sleeves , revealing that the skin of her arms was scaly and green . when she smiled , i saw that her teeth were fangs . the pupils of her eyes were side- ways slits , like a reptile 's . the chihuahua barked louder , and with each bark , it grew . first to the size of a doberman , then to a lion . the bark became a roar . the little boy screamed . his parents pulled him back toward the exit , straight into the park ranger , who stood , paralyzed , gaping at the monster . the chimera was now so tall its back rubbed against the roof . it had the head of a lion with a blood-caked mane , the body and hooves of a giant goat , and a serpent for a tail , a ten-foot-long diamondback growing right out of its shaggy behind . the rhinestone dog collar still hung around its neck , and the plate-sized dog tag was now easy to read : chimera— rabid , fire-breathing , poisonous — if found , please call tartarus ext . 954 . [ 207 ] i realized i had n't even uncapped my sword . my hands were numb . i was ten feet away from the chimera 's bloody maw , and i knew that as soon as i moved , the creature would lunge . the snake lady made a hissing noise that might 've been laughter . `` be honored , percy jackson . lord zeus rarely allows me to test a hero with one of my brood . for i am the mother of monsters , the terrible echidna ! '' i stared at her . all i could think to say was : `` is n't that a kind of anteater ? '' she howled , her reptilian face turning brown and green with rage . `` i hate it when people say that ! i hate australia ! naming that ridiculous animal after me . for that , percy jackson , my son shall destroy you ! '' the chimera charged , its lion teeth gnashing . i man- aged to leap aside and dodge the bite . i ended up next to the family and the park ranger , who were all screaming now , trying to pry open the emergency exit doors . i could n't let them get hurt . i uncapped my sword , ran to the other side of the deck , and yelled , `` hey , chihuahua ! '' the chimera turned faster than i would 've thought possible . before i could swing my sword , it opened its mouth , emitting a stench like the world 's largest barbecue pit , and shot a column of flame straight at me . i dove through the explosion . the carpet burst into flames ; the heat was so intense , it nearly seared off my eye- brows . [ 208 ] where i had been standing a moment before was a ragged hole in the side of the arch , with melted metal steaming around the edges . great , i thought . we just blowtorched a national mon- ument . riptide was now a shining bronze blade in my hands , and as the chimera turned , i slashed at its neck . that was my fatal mistake . the blade sparked harm- lessly off the dog collar . i tried to regain my balance , but i was so worried about defending myself against the fiery lion 's mouth , i completely forgot about the serpent tail until it whipped around and sank its fangs into my calf . my whole leg was on fire . i tried to jab riptide into the chimera 's mouth , but the serpent tail wrapped around my ankles and pulled me off balance , and my blade flew out of my hand , spinning out of the hole in the arch and down toward the mississippi river . i managed to get to my feet , but i knew i had lost . i was weaponless . i could feel deadly poison racing up to my chest . i remembered chiron saying that anaklusmos would always return to me , but there was no pen in my pocket . maybe it had fallen too far away . maybe it only returned when it was in pen form . i did n't know , and i was n't going to live long enough to figure it out . i backed into the hole in the wall . the chimera advanced , growling , smoke curling from its lips . the snake lady , echidna , cackled . `` they do n't make heroes like they used to , eh , son ? '' the monster growled . it seemed in no hurry to finish [ 209 ] me off now that i was beaten . i glanced at the park ranger and the family . the little boy was hiding behind his father 's legs . i had to protect these people . i could n't just . . . die . i tried to think , but my whole body was on fire . my head felt dizzy . i had no sword . i was facing a massive , fire-breathing monster and its mother . and i was scared . there was no place else to go , so i stepped to the edge of the hole . far , far below , the river glittered . if i died , would the monsters go away ? would they leave the humans alone ? `` if you are the son of poseidon , '' echidna hissed , `` you would not fear water . jump , percy jackson . show me that water will not harm you . jump and retrieve your sword . prove your bloodline . '' yeah , right , i thought . i 'd read somewhere that jumping into water from a couple of stories up was like jumping onto solid asphalt . from here , i 'd splatter on impact . the chimera 's mouth glowed red , heating up for an- other blast . `` you have no faith , '' echidna told me . `` you do not trust the gods . i can not blame you , little coward . better you die now . the gods are faithless . the poison is in your heart . '' she was right : i was dying . i could feel my breath slow- ing down . nobody could save me , not even the gods . i backed up and looked down at the water . i remem- bered the warm glow of my father 's smile when i was a baby . he must have seen me . he must have visited me when i was in my cradle . [ 210 ] i remembered the swirling green trident that had appeared above my head the night of capture the flag , when poseidon had claimed me as his son . but this was n't the sea . this was the mississippi , dead center of the usa . there was no sea god here . `` die , faithless one , '' echidna rasped , and the chimera sent a column of flame toward my face . `` father , help me , '' i prayed . i turned and jumped . my clothes on fire , poison cours- ing through my veins , i plummeted toward the river . [ 211 ] i4 l 1 b6c0m€ a 7 known fuqitive i 'd love to tell you i had some deep revelation on my way down , that i came to terms with my own mortality , laughed in the face of death , et cetera . the truth ? my only thought was : aaaaggghhhhh ! the river raced toward me at the speed of a truck . wind ripped the breath from my lungs . steeples and skyscrapers and bridges tumbled in and out of my vision . and then : flaaa-boooom ! a whiteout of bubbles . i sank through the murk , sure that i was about to end up embedded in a hundred feet of mud and lost forever . but my impact with the water had n't hurt . i was falling slowly now , bubbles trickling up through my fingers . i set- tled on the river bottom soundlessly . a catfish the size of my stepfather lurched away into the gloom . clouds of silt and disgusting garbage — beer bottles , old shoes , plastic bags — swirled up all around me . at that point , i realized a few things : first , i had not been flattened into a pancake . i had not been barbecued . i could n't even feel the chimera poison boiling in my veins anymore . i was alive , which was good . second realization : i was n't wet . i mean , i could feel the [ 212 ] coolness of the water . i could see where the fire on my clothes had been quenched . but when i touched my own shirt , it felt perfectly dry . i looked at the garbage floating by and snatched an old cigarette lighter . no way , i thought . i flicked the lighter . it sparked . a tiny flame appeared , right there at the bottom of the mississippi . i grabbed a soggy hamburger wrapper out of the cur- rent and immediately the paper turned dry . i lit it with no problem . as soon as i let it go , the flames sputtered out . the wrapper turned back into a slimy rag . weird . but the strangest thought occurred to me only last : i was breathing . i was underwater , and i was breathing nor- mally . i stood up , thigh-deep in mud . my legs felt shaky . my hands trembled . i should 've been dead . the fact that i was n't seemed like . . . well , a miracle . i imagined a woman 's voice , a voice that sounded a bit like my mother : percy , what do you say ? `` um . . . thanks . '' underwater , i sounded like i did on recordings , like a much older kid . `` thank you . . . father . '' no response . just the dark drift of garbage downriver , the enormous catfish gliding by , the flash of sunset on the water 's surface far above , turning everything the color of butterscotch . why had poseidon saved me ? the more i thought about it , the more ashamed i felt . so i 'd gotten lucky a few times before . against a thing like the chimera , i had never [ 213 ] stood a chance . those poor people in the arch were prob- ably toast . i could n't protect them . i was no hero . maybe i should just stay down here with the catfish , join the bottom feeders . fump-fump-fump . a riverboat 's paddlewheel churned above me , swirling the silt around . there , not five feet in front of me . was my sword , its gleaming bronze hilt sticking up in the mud . i heard that woman 's voice again : percy , take the sword . your father believes in you . this time , i knew the voice was n't in my head . i was n't imagining it . her words seemed to come from everywhere , rippling through the water like dolphin sonar . `` where are you ? '' i called aloud . then , through the gloom , i saw her — a woman the color of the water , a ghost in the current , floating just above the sword . she had long billowing hair , and her eyes , barely visible , were green like mine . a lump formed in my throat . i said , `` mom ? '' no , child , only a messenger , though your mother 's fate is not as hope- less as you believe . go to the beach in santa monica . `` what ? '' it is your father 's will . before you descend into the underworld , you must go to santa monica . please , percy , 1 can not stay long . the river here is too foul for my presence . `` but ... '' i was sure this woman was my mother , or a vision of her , anyway . `` who — how did you — `` there was so much i wanted to ask , the words jammed up in my throat . 1 can not stay , brave one , the woman said . she reached out , [ 214 ] and i felt the current brush my face like a caress . you must go to santa monica ! and , percy , do not trust the gifts . . . . her voice faded . `` gifts ? '' i asked . `` what gifts ? wait ! '' she made one more attempt to speak , but the sound was gone . her image melted away . if it was my mother , i had lost her again . i felt like drowning myself . the only problem : i was immune to drowning . your father believes in you , she had said . shed also called me brave . . . unless she was talking to the catfish . i waded toward riptide and grabbed it by the hilt . the chimera might still be up there with its snaky , fat mother , waiting to finish me off . at the very least , the mortal police would be arriving , trying to figure out who had blown a hole in the arch . if they found me , they 'd have some questions . i capped my sword , stuck the ballpoint pen in my pocket . `` thank you . father , '' i said again to the dark water . then i kicked up through the muck and swam for the surface . i came ashore next to a floating mcdonald 's . a block away , every emergency vehicle in st. louis was surrounding the arch . police helicopters circled overhead . the crowd of onlookers reminded me of times square on new year 's eve . a little girl said , `` mama ! that boy walked out of the river . '' [ 215 ] '' that 's nice , dear , '' her mother said , craning her neck to watch the ambulances . `` but he 's dry ! '' `` that 's nice , dear . '' a news lady was talking for the camera : `` probably not a terrorist attack , we 're told , but it 's still very early in the investigation . the damage , as you can see , is very serious . we 're trying to get to some of the survivors , to question them about eyewitness reports of someone falling from the arch . '' surx ’ ivors . i felt a surge of relief . maybe the park ranger and that family made it out safely . i hoped annabeth and grover were okay . i tried to push through the crowd to see what was going on inside the police line . `` , . . an adolescent boy , '' another reporter was saying . `` channel five has learned that surveillance cameras show an adolescent boy going wild on the observation deck , somehow setting off this freak explosion . hard to believe , john , but that 's what we 're hearing . again , no confirmed fatalities . . . '' i backed away , trying to keep my head down . i had to go a long way around the police perimeter . uniformed offi- cers and news reporters were everywhere . i 'd almost lost hope of ever finding annabeth and grover when a familiar voice bleated , `` perrr-cy ! '' i turned and got tackled by grover 's bear hug — or goat hug . he said , `` we thought you 'd gone to hades the hard way ! [ 216 ] annabeth stood behind him , trying to look angry , but even she seemed relieved to see me . `` we ca n't leave you alone for five minutes ! what happened ? '' `` i sort of fell . '' `` percy ! six hundred and thirty feet ? '' behind us , a cop shouted , `` gangway ! '' the crowd parted , and a couple of paramedics hustled out , rolling a woman on a stretcher . i recognized her immediately as the mother of the little boy who 'd been on the observation deck . she was saying , `` and then this huge dog , this huge fire-breathing chihuahua — `` '' okay , ma'am , '' the paramedic said . `` just calm down . your family is fine . the medication is starting to kick in . '' `` i 'm not crazy ! this boy jumped out of the hole and the monster disappeared . '' then she saw me . `` there he is ! that 's the boy ! '' i turned quickly and pulled annabeth and grover after me . we disappeared into the crowd . `` what 's going on ? '' annabeth demanded . `` was she talking about the chihuahua on the elevator ? '' i told them the whole story of the chimera , echidna , my high-dive act , and the underwater lady 's message . `` whoa , '' said grover . `` we 've got to get you to santa monica ! you ca n't ignore a summons from your dad . '' before annabeth could respond , we passed another reporter doing a news break , and i almost froze in my tracks when he said , `` percy jackson . that 's right , dan . channel twelve has learned that the boy who may have caused this explosion fits the description of a young man wanted by [ 217 ] authorities for a serious new jersey bus accident three days ago . and the boy is believed to be traveling west . for our viewers at home , here is a photo of percy jackson . '' we ducked around the news van and slipped into an alley . `` first things first , '' i told grover . `` we 've got to get out of town ! '' somehow , we made it back to the amtrak station with- out getting spotted . we got on board the train just before it pulled out for denver . the train trundled west as darkness fell , police lights still pulsing against the st. louis skyline behind us . [ 218 ] i5 i a qod buys us f ch€€s€burcj€rs the next afternoon , june 14 , seven days before the sol- stice , our train rolled into denver . we had n't eaten since the night before in the dining car , somewhere in kansas . we had n't taken a shower since half-blood hill , and i was sure that was obvious . `` let 's try to contact chiron , '' annabeth said . `` i want to tell him about your talk with the river spirit . '' `` we ca n't use phones , right ? '' `` i 'm not talking about phones . '' we wandered through downtown for about half an hour , though i was n't sure what annabeth was looking for . the air was dry and hot , which felt weird after the humid- ity of st. louis . everywhere we turned , the rocky mountains seemed to be staring at me , like a tidal wave about to crash into the city . finally we found an empty do-it-yourself car wash. we veered toward the stall farthest from the street , keeping our eyes open for patrol cars . we were three adolescents hang- ing out at a car wash without a car ; any cop worth his doughnuts would figure we were up to no good . `` what exactly are we doing ? '' i asked , as grover took out the spray gun . [ 219 ] '' it 's seventy-five cents , '' he grumbled . `` i 've only got two quarters left . annabeth ? ” '' do n't look at me , '' she said . `` the dining car wiped me out . '' i fished out my last bit of change and passed grover a quarter , which left me two nickels and one drachma from medusa 's place . `` excellent , '' grover said . `` we could do it with a spray bottle , of course , but the connection is n't as good , and my arm gets tired of pumping. ” '' what are you talking about ? '' he fed in the quarters and set the knob to fine mist . `` i- m'ing . '' `` instant messaging ? ” '' iris-messaging , '' annabeth corrected . `` the rainbow god- dess iris carries messages for the gods . if you know how to ask , and she 's not too busy , she 'll do the same for half-bloods. ” '' you summon the goddess with a spray gun ? '' grover pointed the nozzle in the air and water hissed out in a thick white mist . `` unless you know an easier way to make a rainbow. ” sure enough , late afternoon light filtered through the vapor and broke into colors . annabeth held her palm out to me . `` drachma , please . '' i handed it over . she raised the coin over her head . ' '' o goddess , accept our offering . '' she threw the drachma into the rainbow . it disappeared in a golden shimmer . [ 220 | '' half-blood hill , '' annabeth requested . for a moment , nothing happened . then i was looking through the mist at strawberry- fields , and the long island sound in the distance . we seemed to be on the porch of the big house . standing with his back to us at the railing was a sandy-haired guy in shorts and an orange tank top . he was holding a bronze sword and seemed to be staring intently at something down in the meadow . `` luke ! '' i called . he turned , eyes wide . i could swear he was standing three feet in front of me through a screen of mist , except i could only see the part of him that appeared in the rainbow . `` percy ! '' his scarred face broke into a grin . `` is that annabeth , too ? thank the gods ! are you guys okay ? '' `` were . . . uh . . . fine , '' annabeth stammered . she was madly straightening her dirty t-shirt , trying to comb the loose hair out of her face . `` we thought — chiron — i mean — `` '' he 's down at the cabins . '' luke 's smile faded . `` we 're having some issues with the campers . listen , is everything cool with you ? is grover all right ? '' `` i 'm right here , '' grover called . he held the nozzle out to one side and stepped into luke 's line of vision . `` what kind of issues ? '' just then a big lincoln continental pulled into the car wash with its stereo turned to maximum hip-hop . as the car slid into the next stall , the bass from the subwoofers vibrated so much , it shook the pavement . [ 221 ] '' chiron had to — what 's that noise ? '' luke yelled . `` i 'll take care of it ! '' annabeth yelled back , looking very relieved to have an excuse to get out of sight . `` grover , come on ! `` what ? '' grover said . `` but — `` '' give percy the nozzle and come on ! '' she ordered . grover muttered something about girls being harder to understand than the oracle at delphi , then he handed me the spray gun and followed annabeth . i readjusted the hose so i could keep the rainbow going and still see luke . `` chiron had to break up a fight , '' luke shouted to me over the music . `` things are pretty tense here , percy . word leaked out about the zeus — poseidon standoff . we 're still not sure how — probably the same scumbag who sum- moned the hellhound . now the campers are starting to take sides . it 's shaping up like the trojan war all over again . aphrodite , ares , and apollo are backing poseidon , more or less . athena is backing zeus . '' i shuddered to think that clarisse 's cabin would ever be on my dad 's side for anything . in the next stall , i heard annabeth and some guy arguing with each other , then the music 's volume decreased drastically . `` so what 's your status ? '' luke asked me . `` chiron will be sorry he missed you . '' i told him pretty much everything , including my dreams . it felt so good to see him , to feel like i was back at camp even for a few minutes , that i did n't realize how long i had talked until the beeper went off on the spray machine , [ 222 ] and i realized i only had one more minute before the water shut off . `` i wish i could be there , '' luke told me . `` we ca n't help much from here , i 'm afraid , but listen ... it had to be hades who took the master bolt . he was there at olympus at the winter solstice . i was chaperoning a field trip and we saw him . '' `` but chiron said the gods ca n't take each other 's magic items directly . '' `` that 's true , '' luke said , looking troubled . `` still . . . hades has the helm of darkness . how could anybody else sneak into the throne room and steal the master bolt ? you 'd have to be invisible . '' we were both silent , until luke seemed to realize what he 'd said . `` oh , hey , '' he protested . `` i did n't mean annabeth . she and i have known each other forever . she would never ... i mean , she 's like a little sister to me . '' i wondered if annabeth would like that description . in the stall next to us , the music stopped completely . a man screamed in terror , car doors slammed , and the lincoln peeled out of the car wash. '' you 'd better go see what that was , '' luke said . `` listen , are you wearing the flying shoes ? i 'll feel better if i know they 've done you some good . '' `` oh . . . uh , yeah ! '' i tried not to sound like a guilty liar . `` yeah , they 've come in handy . '' `` really ? '' he grinned . `` they fit and everything ? '' the water shut off . the mist started to evaporate . `` well , take care of yourself out there in denver , '' luke [ 223 ] called , his voice getting fainter . `` and tell grover it 'll be bet- ter this time ! nobody will get turned into a pine tree if he just — but the mist was gone , and luke 's image faded to noth- ing . i was alone in a wet , empty car wash stall . annabeth and grover came around the corner , laugh- ing , but stopped when they saw my face . annabeth 's smile faded . `` what happened , percy ? what did luke say ? '' `` not much , '' i lied , my stomach feeling as empty as a big three cabin . `` come on , let 's find some dinner . '' a few minutes later , we were sitting at a booth in a gleam- ing chrome diner . all around us , families were eating burg- ers and drinking malts and sodas . finally the waitress came over . she raised her eyebrow skeptically . `` well ? '' i said , `` we , um , want to order dinner . '' `` you kids have money to pay for it ? '' grover 's lower lip quivered . i was afraid he would start bleating , or worse , start eating the linoleum . annabeth looked ready to pass out from hunger . i was trying to think up a sob story for the waitress when a rumble shook the whole building ; a motorcycle the size of a baby elephant had pulled up to the curb . all conversation in the diner stopped . the motorcycle 's headlight glared red . its gas tank had flames painted on it , and a shotgun holster riveted to either side , complete with shotguns . the seat was leather — but leather that looked like . . . well , caucasian human skin . [ 224 ] the guy on the bike would 've made pro wrestlers run for mama . he was dressed in a red muscle shirt and black jeans and a black leather duster , with a hunting knife strapped to his thigh . he wore red wraparound shades , and he had the cruelest , most brutal face id ever seen — handsome , i guess , but wicked — with an oily black crew cut and cheeks that were scarred from many , many fights . the weird thing was , i felt like id seen his face somewhere before . as he walked into the diner , a hot , dry wind blew through the place . all the people rose , as if they were hyp- notized , but the biker waved his hand dismissively and they all sat down again . everybody went back to their conversa- tions . the waitress blinked , as if somebody had just pressed the rewind button on her brain . she asked us again , `` you kids have money to pay for it ? '' the biker said , `` it 's on me . '' he slid into our booth , which was way too small for him , and crowded annabeth against the window . he looked up at the waitress , who was gaping at him , and said , `` are you still here ? '' he pointed at her , and she stiffened . she turned as if she 'd been spun around , then marched back toward the kitchen . the biker looked at me . i could n't see his eyes behind the red shades , but bad feelings started boiling in my stom- ach . anger , resentment , bitterness . i wanted to hit a wall . i wanted to pick a fight with somebody . who did this guy think he was ? [ 225 ] he gave me a wicked grin . `` so you 're old seaweed 's kid , huh ? '' i should 've been surprised , or scared , but instead i felt like i was looking at my stepdad , gabe . i wanted to rip this guy 's head off . `` what 's it to you ? '' annabeth 's eyes flashed me a warning . `` percy , this is — `` the biker raised his hand . `` s'okay , '' he said . `` i do n't mind a little attitude . long as you remember who 's the boss . you know who i am , little cousin ? '' then it struck me why this guy looked familiar . he had the same vicious sneer as some of the kids at camp half- blood , the ones from cabin five . `` you 're clarisse 's dad , '' i said . `` ares , god of war . '' ares grinned and took off his shades . where his eyes should 've been , there was only fire , empty sockets glowing with miniature nuclear explosions . `` that 's right , punk . i heard you broke clarisse 's spear . '' `` she was asking for it . '' `` probably . that 's cool . i do n't fight my kids ' fights , you know ? what i 'm here for — i heard you were in town . i got a little proposition for you . '' the waitress came back with heaping trays of food — cheeseburgers , fries , onion rings , and chocolate shakes . ares handed her a few gold drachmas . she looked nervously at the coins . `` but , these are n't . ares pulled out his huge knife and started cleaning his fingernails . `` problem , sweetheart ? '' the waitress swallowed , then left with the gold . [ 226 ] '' you ca n't do that , '' i told ares . `` you ca n't just threaten people with a knife . '' ares laughed . `` are you kidding ? i love this country . best place since sparta . do n't you carry a weapon , punk ? you should . dangerous world out there . which brings me to my proposition . i need you to do me a favor . '' `` what favor could i do for a god ? '' `` something a god does n't have time to do himself . it 's nothing much . i left my shield at an abandoned water park here in town . i was going on a little . . . date with my girl- friend . we were interrupted . i left my shield behind . i want you to fetch it for me . '' `` why do n't you go back and get it yourself ? '' the fire in his eye sockets glowed a little hotter . `` why do n't i turn you into prairie dog and run you over with my harley ? because i do n't feel like it . a god is giving you an opportunity to prove yourself . percy jackson . will you prove yourself a coward ? '' he leaned forward . `` or maybe you only fight when there 's a river to dive into , so your daddy can protect you . '' i wanted to punch this guy , but somehow , i knew he was waiting for that . ares 's power was causing my anger . he 'd love it if i attacked . i did n't want to give him the satisfac- tion . `` we 're not interested , '' i said . `` we 've already got a quest. `` ares 's fiery eyes made me see things i did n't want to see — blood and smoke and corpses on the battlefield . `` i know all about your quest , punk . when that item was [ 227 ] first stolen , zeus sent his best out looking for it : apollo , athena , artemis , and me , naturally . if i could n't sniff out a weapon that powerful . . he licked his lips , as if the very thought of the master bolt made him hungry . `` well ... if i could n't find it , you got no hope . nevertheless , i 'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt . your dad and i go way back . after all , i 'm the one who told him my suspicions about old corpse breath . '' `` you told him hades stole the bolt ? '' `` sure . framing somebody to start a war . oldest trick in the book . i recognized it immediately . in a way , you got me to thank for your little quest . '' `` thanks , '' i grumbled . `` hey , i 'm a generous guy . just do my little job , and i 'll help you on your way . i 'll arrange a ride west for you and your friends . '' `` we 're doing fine on our own . '' `` yeah , right . no money . no wheels . no clue what you 're up against . help me out , and maybe i 'll tell you something you need to know . something about your mom . '' `` my mom ? '' he grinned . `` that got your attention . the water park is a mile west on delaney . you ca n't miss it . look for the tunnel of love ride . '' `` what interrupted your date ? '' i asked . `` something scare you off ? '' ares bared his teeth , but i 'd seen his threatening look before on clarisse . there was something false about it , almost like he was nervous . [ 228 ] '' you 're lucky you met me , punk , and not one of the other olympians . they 're not as forgiving of rudeness as i am . i 'll meet you back here when you 're done . do n't disap- point me . '' after that i must have fainted , or fallen into a trance , because when i opened my eyes again , ares was gone . i might 've thought the conversation had been a dream , but annabeth and grover 's expressions told me otherwise . `` not good , '' grover said . `` ares sought you out , percy . this is not good . '' i stared out the window . the motorcycle had disap- peared . did ares really know something about my mom , or was he just playing with me ? now that he was gone , all the anger had drained out of me . i realized ares must love to mess with people 's emotions . that was his power — crank- ing up the passions so badly , they clouded your ability to think . `` it 's probably some kind of trick , '' i said . `` forget ares . let 's just go . '' `` we ca n't , '' annabeth said . `` look , i hate ares as much as anybody , but you do n't ignore the gods unless you want serious bad fortune . he was n't kidding about turning you into a rodent . '' i looked down at my cheeseburger , which suddenly did n't seem so appetizing . `` why does he need us ? '' `` maybe it 's a problem that requires brains , '' annabeth said . `` ares has strength . that 's all he has . even strength has to bow to wisdom sometimes . '' [ 229 ] '' but this water park ... he acted almost scared . what would make a war god run away like that ? '' annabeth and grover glanced nervously at each other . annabeth said , `` i 'm afraid we 'll have to find out . '' the sun was sinking behind the mountains by the time we found the water park . judging from the sign , it once had been called waterland , but now some of the letters were smashed out , so it read wat rad . the main gate was padlocked and topped with barbed wire . inside , huge dry waterslides and tubes and pipes curled everywhere , leading to empty pools . old tickets and adver- tisements fluttered around the asphalt . with night coming on , the place looked sad and creepy . `` if ares brings his girlfriend here for a date , '' i said , star- ing up at the barbed wire , `` i 'd hate to see what she looks like . '' `` percy , '' annabeth warned . `` be more respectful . '' `` why ? i thought you hated ares . '' `` he 's still a god . and his girlfriend is very tempera- mental . '' `` you do n't want to insult her looks , '' grover added . `` who is she ? echidna ? '' `` no , aphrodite , '' grover said , a little dreamily . `` goddess of love . '' `` i thought she was married to somebody , '' i said . `` hephaestus . `` `` what 's your point ? '' he asked . `` oh . '' i suddenly felt the need to change the subject . `` so how do we get in ? '' [ 230 ] '' mciia ! '' grover 's shoes sprouted wings . he flew over the fence , did an unintended somersault in midair , then stumbled to a landing on the opposite side . he dusted off his jeans , as if he 'd planned the whole thing . `` you guys coming ? ” annabeth and i had to climb the old-fashioned way , holding down the barbed wire for each other as we crawled over the top . the shadows grew long as we walked through the park , checking out the attractions . there was ankle biter island , head over wedgie , and dude , where 's my swimsuit ? no monsters came to get us . nothing made the slight- est noise . we found a souvenir shop that had been left open . merchandise still lined the shelves : snow globes , pencils , postcards , and racks of— '' clothes , '' annabeth said . `` fresh clothes. ” '' yeah , ” i said . `` but you ca n't just — `` '' watch me. ” she snatched an entire row of stuff of the racks and disappeared into the changing room . a few minutes later she came out in waterland flower-print shorts , a big red waterland t-shirt , and commemorative waterland surf shoes . a waterland backpack was slung over her shoulder , obviously stuffed with more goodies . `` what the heck. ” grover shrugged . soon , all three of us were decked out like walking advertisements for the defunct theme park . we continued searching for the tunnel of love . i got [ 231 ] the feeling that the whole park was holding its breath . `` so ares and aphrodite , '' i said , to keep my mind off the grow- ing dark , `` they have a thing going ? '' `` that 's old gossip , percy , '' annabeth told me . `` three- thousand-year-old gossip . '' `` what about aphrodite 's husband ? '' `` well , you know , '' she said . `` hephaestus . the black- smith . he was crippled when he was a baby , thrown off mount olympus by zeus . so he is n't exactly handsome . clever with his hands , and all , but aphrodite is n't into brains and talent , you know ? '' `` she likes bikers . '' `` whatever . '' `` hephaestus knows ? '' `` oh sure , '' annabeth said . `` he caught them together once . i mean , literally caught them , in a golden net , and invited all the gods to come and laugh at them . hephaestus is always trying to embarrass them . that 's why they meet in out-of-the-way places , like . . . '' she stopped , looking straight ahead . `` like that . '' in front of us was an empty pool that would 've been awesome for skateboarding . it was at least fifty yards across and shaped like a bowl . around the rim , a dozen bronze statues of cupid stood guard with wings spread and bows ready to fire . on the opposite side from us , a tunnel opened up , probably where the water flowed into when the pool was full . the sign above it read , thrill ride o ' love : this is not your parents ' tunnel of love ! [ 232 ] grover crept toward the edge . `` guys , look . '' marooned at the bottom of the pool was a pink- and-white two-seater boat with a canopy over the top and little hearts painted all over it . in the left seat , glinting in the fading light , was ares 's shield , a polished circle of bronze . `` this is too easy , '' i said . `` so we just walk down there and get it ? '' annabeth ran her fingers along the base of the nearest cupid statue . `` there 's a greek letter carved here , '' she said . `` eta . i wonder . . . '' `` grover , '' i said , `` you smell any monsters ? '' he sniffed the wind . `` nothing . '' `` nothing — like , in-me-arch-and-you-didn't-smell-echidna nothing , or really nothing ? '' grover looked hurt . `` i told you , that was underground . '' `` okay , i 'm sorry . '' i took a deep breath . `` i 'm going down there . '' `` i 'll go with you . '' grover did n't sound too enthusiastic , but i got the feeling he was trying to make up for what had happened in st. louis . `` no , '' i told him . `` i want you to stay up top with the flying shoes . you 're the red baron , a flying ace , remember ? i 'll be counting on you for backup , in case something goes wrong. `` grover puffed up his chest a little . `` sure . but what could go wrong ? '' `` i do n't know . just a feeling . annabeth , come with me — `` [ 233 ] '' are you kidding ? '' she looked at me as if id just dropped from the moon . her cheeks were bright red . `` what 's the problem now ? '' i demanded . `` me , go with you to the . . . the 'thrill ride of love ’ ? how embarrassing is that ? what if somebody saw me ? '' `` who ’ s going to see you ? '' but my face was burning now , too . leave it to a girl to make everything complicated . `` fine , '' i told her . `` i 'll do it myself . '' but when i started down the side of the pool , she followed me , muttering about how boys always messed things up . we reached the boat . the shield was propped on one seat , and next to it was a lady 's silk scarf . i tried to imagine ares and aphrodite here , a couple of gods meeting in a junked-out amusement-park ride . why ? then i noticed something i had n't seen from up top : mirrors all the way around the rim of the pool , facing this spot . we could see ourselves no matter which direction we looked . that must be it . while ares and aphrodite were smooching with each other they could look at their favorite people : them- selves . i picked up the scarf . it shimmered pink , and the perfume was indescribable — rose , or mountain laurel . something good . i smiled , a little dreamy , and was about to rub the scarf against my cheek when annabeth ripped it out of my hand and stuffed it in her pocket . `` oh , no you do n't . stay away from that love magic . '' `` what ? '' `` just get the shield , seaweed brain , and let 's get out of here . '' [ 234 ] the moment i touched the shield , i knew we were in trouble . my hand broke through something that had been connecting it to the dashboard . a cobweb , i thought , but then i looked at a strand of it on my palm and saw it was some kind of metal filament , so fine it was almost invisible . a trip wire . `` wait , '' annabeth said . `` too late . '' `` there 's another greek letter on the side of the boat , another eta . this is a trap . '' noise erupted all around us , of a million gears grinding , as if the whole pool were turning into one giant machine . grover yelled , `` guys ! '' up on the rim , the cupid statues were drawing their bows into firing position . before i could suggest taking cover , they shot , but not at us . they fired at each other , across the rim of the pool . silky cables trailed from the arrows , arcing over the pool and anchoring where they landed to form a huge golden asterisk . then smaller metallic threads started weaving together magically between the main strands , making a net . `` we have to get out , '' i said . `` duh ! '' annabeth said . i grabbed the shield and we ran , but going up the slope of the pool was not as easy as going down . `` come on ! '' grover shouted . he was trying to hold open a section of the net for us , but wherever he touched it , the golden threads started to wrap around his hands . [ 235 ] the cupids ' heads popped open . out came video cam- eras . spotlights rose up all around the pool , blinding us with illumination , and a loudspeaker voice boomed : `` live to olympus in one minute . . . fifty-nine seconds , fifty- eight . . . '' `` hephaestus ! '' annabeth screamed . `` i 'm so stupid ! eta is '' h.'he made this trap to catch his wife with ares . now we 're going to be broadcast live to olympus and look like absolute fools ! '' we 'd almost made it to the rim when the row of mir- rors opened like hatches and thousands of tiny metallic . . . things poured out . annabeth screamed . it was an army of wind-up creepy-crawlies : bronze-gear bodies , spindly legs , little pincer mouths , all scuttling toward us in a wave of clacking , whirring metal . `` spiders ! '' annabeth said . `` sp — sp-aaaah ! ” i 'd never seen her like this before . she fell backward in terror and almost got overwhelmed by the spider robots before i pulled her up and dragged her back toward the boat . the things were coming out from all around the rim now , millions of them , flooding toward the center of the pool , completely surrounding us . i told myself they proba- bly were n't programmed to kill , just corral us and bite us and make us look stupid . then again , this was a trap meant for gods . and we were n't gods . annabeth and i climbed into the boat . i started kicking away the spiders as they swarmed aboard . i yelled at [ 236 ] annabeth to help me , but she was too paralyzed to do much more than scream . `` thirty , twenty-nine , '' called the loudspeaker . the spiders started spitting out strands of metal thread , trying to tie us down . the strands were easy enough to break at first , but there were so many of them , and the spi- ders just kept coming . i kicked one away from annabeth 's leg and its pincers took a chunk out of my new surf shoe . grover hovered above the pool in his flying sneakers , trying to pull the net loose , but it would n't budge . think , i told myself . think . the tunnel of love entrance was under the net . we could use it as an exit , except that it was blocked by a mil- lion robot spiders . `` fifteen , fourteen , '' the loudspeaker called . water , i thought . where does the ride 's water come from ? then i saw them : huge water pipes behind the mirrors , where the spiders had come from . and up above the net , next to one of the cupids , a glass-windowed booth that must be the controller 's station . `` grover ! '' i yelled . `` get into that booth ! find the 'on ' switch ! `` `` but — `` '' do it ! '' it was a crazy hope , but it was our only chance . the spiders were all over the prow of the boat now . annabeth was screaming her head off . i had to get us out of there . [ 237 ] grover was in the controller 's booth now , slamming away at the buttons , '' five , four — `` grover looked up at me hopelessly , raising his hands . he was letting me know that he 'd pushed every button , but still nothing was happening . i closed my eyes and thought about waves , rushing water , the mississippi river . i felt a familiar tug in my gut . i tried to imagine that i was dragging the ocean all the way to denver . `` two , one , zero ! '' water exploded out of the pipes . it roared into the pool , sweeping away the spiders . i pulled annabeth into the seat next to me and fastened her seat belt just as the tidal wave slammed into our boat , over the top , whisking the spiders away and dousing us completely , but not capsizing us . the boat turned , lifted in the flood , and spun in circles around the whirlpool . the water was full of short-circuiting spiders , some of them smashing against the pool 's concrete wall with such force they burst . spotlights glared down at us . the cupid-cams were rolling , live to olympus . but i could only concentrate on controlling the boat . i willed it to ride the current , to keep away from the wall . maybe it was my imagination , but the boat seemed to respond . at least , it did n't break into a million pieces . we spun around one last time , the water level now almost high enough to shred us against the metal net . then the boat 's [ 238 ] nose turned toward the tunnel and we rocketed through into the darkness . annabeth and i held tight , both of us screaming as the boat shot curls and hugged corners and took forty-five- degree plunges past pictures of romeo and juliet and a bunch of other valentine s day stuff . then we were out of the tunnel , the night air whistling through our hair as the boat barreled straight toward the exit . if the ride had been in working order , we would 've sailed off a ramp between the golden gates of love and splashed down safely in the exit pool . but there was a prob- lem . the gates of love were chained . two boats that had been washed out of the tunnel before us were now piled against the barricade — one submerged , the other cracked in half . `` unfasten your seat belt . '' i yelled to annabeth . `` are you crazy ? '' `` unless you want to get smashed to death . '' i strapped ares 's shield to my arm . `` we 're going to have to jump for it . '' my idea was simple and insane . as the boat struck , we would use its force like a springboard to jump the gate . i 'd heard of people surviving car crashes that way , getting thrown thirty or forty feet away from an accident . with luck , we would land in the pool . annabeth seemed to understand . she gripped my hand as the gates got closer . `` on my mark , '' i said . `` no ! on my mark ! '' [ 239 ] '' what ? '' `` simple physics ! '' she yelled . `` force times the trajectory angle — '' fine ! '' i shouted . `` on war mark ! '' she hesitated . . . hesitated . . . then yelled , `` now ! '' crack ! annabeth was right . if wed jumped when i thought we should 've , we would 've crashed into the gates . she got us maximum lift . unfortunately , that was a little more than we needed . our boat smashed into the pileup and we were thrown into the air , straight over the gates , over the pool , and down toward solid asphalt . something grabbed me from behind . annabeth yelled , `` ouch ! '' grover ! in midair , he had grabbed me by the shirt , and annabeth by the arm , and was trying to pull us out of a crash landing , but annabeth and i had all the momentum . `` you 're too heavy ! '' grover said . `` we 're going down ! '' we spiraled toward the ground , grover doing his best to slow the fall . we smashed into a photo-board , grover 's head going straight into the hole where tourists would put their faces , pretending to be noo-noo the friendly wh ale . annabeth and i tumbled to the ground , banged up but alive . ares 's shield was still on my arm . once we caught our breath , annabeth and i got grover out of the photo-board and thanked him for saving our [ 240 ] lives . i looked back at the thrill ride of love . the water was subsiding . our boat had been smashed to pieces against the gates . a hundred yards away , at the entrance pool , the cupids were still filming . the statues had swiveled so that their cameras were trained straight on us , the spotlights in our faces . `` show 's over ! '' i yelled . `` thank you ! good night ! '' the cupids turned back to their original positions . t h e lights shut off . the park went quiet and dark again , except for the gentle trickle of water into the thrill ride of love 's exit pool . i wondered if olympus had gone to a commer- cial break , or if our ratings had been any good . i hated being teased . i hated being tricked . and i had plenty of experience handling bullies who liked to do that stuff to me . i hefted the shield on my arm and turned to my friends . `` we need to have a little talk with ares . '' [ 241 ] 16 ♦ w€ tai « e a z6bra to v€qas the war god was waiting for us in the diner parking lot . `` well , well , '' he said . `` you did n't get yourself killed . '' `` you knew it was a trap , '' i said . ares gave me a wicked grin . `` bet that crippled black- smith was surprised when he netted a couple of stupid kids . you looked good on tv '' i shoved his shield at him . `` you 're a jerk . '' annabeth and grover caught their breath . ares grabbed the shield and spun it in the air like pizza dough . it changed form , melting into a bulletproof vest . he slung it across his back . `` see that truck over there ? '' he pointed to an eighteen- wheeler parked across the street from the diner . `` that 's your ride . take you straight to l.a. , with one stop in vegas . '' the eighteen- wheeler had a sign on the back , which i could read only because it was reverse-printed white on black , a good combination for dyslexia : kindness inter- national : humane zoo transport . warning : live wild animals . i said , `` you 're kidding . '' ares snapped his fingers . the back door of the truck [ 242 ] unlatched . `` free ride west , punk . stop complaining . and here 's a little something for doing the job . '' he slung a blue nylon backpack off his handlebars and tossed it to me . inside were fresh clothes for all of us , twenty bucks in cash , a pouch full of golden drachmas , and a bag of double stuf oreos . i said , `` i do n't want your lousy — `` '' thank you . lord ares , '' grover interrupted , giving me his best red-alert warning look . `` thanks a lot . '' i gritted my teeth . it was probably a deadly insult to refuse something from a god , but i did n't want anything that ares had touched . reluctantly , i slung the backpack over my shoulder . i knew my anger was being caused by the war god 's presence , but i was still itching to punch him in the nose . he reminded me of every bully i 'd ever faced : nancy bobofit , clarisse , smelly gabe , sarcastic teachers — every jerk who 'd called me stupid in school or laughed at me when i 'd gotten expelled . i looked back at the diner , which had only a couple of customers now . the waitress who 'd served us dinner was watching nervously out the window , like she was afraid ares might hurt us . she dragged the fry cook out from the kitchen to see . she said something to him . he nodded , held up a little disposable camera and snapped a picture of us . great , i thought . we 'll make the papers again tomorrow . i imagined the headline : twelve- year-old outlaw beats up defenseless biker . `` you owe me one more thing , '' i told ares , trying to [ 243 ] keep my voice level . `` you promised me information about my mother . '' `` you sure you can handle the news ? '' he kick-started his motorcycle . `` she 's not dead . '' the ground seemed to spin beneath me . `` what do you mean ? `` i mean she was taken away from the minotaur before she could die . she was turned into a shower of gold , right ? that 's metamorphosis . not death . she 's being kept . '' `` kept . why ? '' `` you need to study war , punk . hostages . you take somebody to control somebody else . '' `` nobody 's controlling me . '' he laughed . `` oh yeah ? see you around , kid . '' i balled up my fists . `` you 're pretty smug . lord ares , for a guy who runs from cupid statues . '' behind his sunglasses , fire glowed . 1 felt a hot wind in my hair . `` we 'll meet again , percy jackson . next time you 're in a fight , watch your back . '' he revved his harley , then roared off down delaney street . annabeth said , `` that was not smart , percy . '' `` i do n't care . '' `` you do n't want a god as your enemy . especially not that god . '' `` hey , guys , '' grover said . `` i hate to interrupt , but . . . '' he pointed toward the diner . at the register , the last two customers were paying their check , two men in identi- cal black coveralls , with a white logo on their backs that [ 244 ] matched the one on the kindness international truck . `` if we 're taking the zoo express , '' grover said , `` we need to hurry . '' i did n't like it , but we had no better option . besides , i 'd seen enough of denver . we ran across the street and climbed in the back of the big rig , closing the doors behind us . the first thing that hit me was the smell . it was like the world 's biggest pan of kitty litter . the trailer was dark inside until i uncapped anaklusmos . the blade cast a faint bronze light over a very sad scene . sitting in a row of filthy metal cages were three of the most pathetic zoo animals i 'd ever beheld : a zebra , a male albino lion , and some weird antelope thing i did n't know the name for . someone had thrown the lion a sack of turnips , which he obviously did n't want to eat . the zebra and the antelope had each gotten a styrofoam tray of hamburger meat . the zebra 's mane was matted with chewing gum , like somebody had been spitting on it in their spare time . the antelope had a stupid silver birthday balloon tied to one of his horns that read over the hill ! apparently , nobody had wanted to get close enough to the lion to mess with him , but the poor thing was pacing around on soiled blankets , in a space way too small for him , panting from the stuffy heat of the trailer . he had flies buzzing around his pink eyes and his ribs showed through his white fur . [ 245 ] '' this is kindness ? '' grover yelled . `` humane zoo trans- port ? '' he probably would 've gone right back outside to beat up the truckers with his reed pipes , and i would 've helped him , but just then the truck 's engine roared to life , the trailer started shaking , and we were forced to sit down or fall down . we huddled in the corner on some mildewed feed sacks , trying to ignore the smell and the heat and the flies . grover talked to the animals in a series of goat bleats , but they just stared at him sadly . annabeth was in favor of breaking the cages and freeing them on the spot , but i pointed out it would n't do much good until the truck stopped moving . besides , i had a feeling we might look a lot better to the lion than those turnips . i found a water jug and refilled their bowls , then used anaklusmos to drag the mismatched food out of their cages . i gave the meat to the lion and the turnips to the zebra and the antelope . grover calmed the antelope down , while annabeth used her knife to cut the balloon off his horn . she wanted to cut the gum out of the zebra 's mane , too , but we decided that would be too risky with the truck bumping around . we told grover to promise the animals we 'd help them more in the morning , then we settled in for night . grover curled up on a turnip sack ; annabeth opened our bag of double stuf oreos and nibbled on one half- heartedly ; i tried to cheer myself up by concentrating on the fact that we were halfway to los angeles . halfway to our [ 246 ] destination . it was only june fourteenth . the solstice was n't until the twenty-first . we could make it in plenty of time . on the other hand , i had no idea what to expect next . the gods kept toying with me . at least hephaestus had the decency to be honest about it — he 'd put up cameras and advertised me as entertainment . but even when the cameras were n't rolling , i had a feeling my quest was being watched . i was a source of amusement for the gods . `` hey , '' annabeth said , `` i 'm sorry for freaking out back at the water park , percy . '' `` that 's okay . '' `` it 's just . . . '' she shuddered . `` spiders . '' `` because of the arachne story , '' i guessed . `` she got turned into a spider for challenging your mom to a weaving contest , right ? '' annabeth nodded . `` arachne 's children have been taking revenge on the children of athena ever since . if there 's a spider within a mile of me , it 'll find me . i hate the creepy little things . anyway , i owe you . '' `` we 're a team , remember ? '' i said . `` besides , grover did the fancy flying. `` i thought he was asleep , but he mumbled from the cor- ner , `` i was pretty amazing , was n't i ? '' annabeth and i laughed . she pulled apart an oreo , handed me half . `` in the iris message . . . did luke really say nothing ? '' i munched my cookie and thought about how to answer . the conversation via rainbow had bothered me all evening . `` luke said you and he go way back . he also said grover [ 247 ] would n't fail this time . nobody would turn into a pine tree . in the dim bronze light of the sword blade , it was hard to read their expressions . grover let out a mournful bray . `` i should 've told you the truth from the beginning . '' his voice trembled . `` i thought if you knew what a failure i was , you would n't want me along . '' `` you were the satyr who tried to rescue thalia , the daughter of zeus . '' he nodded glumly . `` and the other two half-bloods thalia befriended , the ones who got safely to camp ... '' i looked at annabeth . `` that was you and luke , was n't it ? '' she put down her oreo , uneaten . `` like you said , percy , a seven-year-old half-blood would n't have made it very far alone . athena guided me toward help . thalia was twelve . luke was fourteen . they 'd both run away from home , like me . they were happy to take me with them . they were . . . amazing monster-fighters , even without training . we trav- eled north from virginia without any real plans , fending off monsters for about two weeks before grover found us . '' `` i was supposed to escort thalia to camp , '' he said , snif- fling . `` only thalia . i had strict orders from chiron : do n't do anything that would slow down the rescue . we knew hades was after her , see , but i could n't just leave luke and annabeth by themselves . i thought ... i thought i could lead all three of them to safety . it was my fault the kindly ones caught up with us . i froze . i got scared on the way [ 248 ] back to camp and took some wrong turns . if id just been a little quicker . . `` stop it , '' annabeth said . `` no one blames you . thalia did n't blame you either . '' `` she sacrificed herself to save us , '' he said miserably . `` her death was my fault . the council of cloven elders said so . '' `` because you would n't leave two other half-bloods behind ? '' i said . `` that 's not fair . '' `` percy 's right , '' annabeth said . `` i would n't be here today if it were n't for you , grover . neither would luke . we do n't care what the council says . '' grover kept sniffling in the dark . `` it 's just my luck . i 'm the lamest satyr ever , and i find the two most powerful half- bloods of the century , thalia and percy . '' `` you 're not lame , '' annabeth insisted . `` you 've got more courage than any satyr i 've ever met . name one other who would dare go to the underworld . i bet percy is really glad you 're here right now . '' she kicked me in the shin . `` yeah , '' i said , which i would 've done even without the kick . `` it 's not luck that you found thalia and me , grover . you 've got the biggest heart of any satyr ever . you 're a nat- ural searcher . that 's why you 'll be the one who finds pan . '' i heard a deep , satisfied sigh . i waited for grover to say something , but his breathing only got heavier . when the sound turned to snoring , i realized he 'd fallen sleep . `` how does he do that ? '' i marveled . `` i do n't know , '' annabeth said . `` but that was really a nice thing you told him . '' [ 249 ] '' i meant it . '' we rode in silence for a few miles , bumping around on the feed sacks . the zebra munched a turnip . the lion licked the last of the hamburger meat off his lips and looked at me hopefully . annabeth rubbed her necklace like she was thinking deep , strategic thoughts . `` that pine-tree bead , '' i said . `` is that from your first year ? she looked . she had n't realized what she was doing . `` yeah , '' she said . `` every august , the counselors pick the most important event of the summer , and they paint it on that year 's beads . i 've got thalia 's pine tree , a greek trireme on fire , a centaur in a prom dress — now that was a weird summer . . . . '' `` and the college ring is your father 's ? '' `` that 's none of your — `` she stopped herself . `` yeah . yeah , it is . '' `` you do n't have to tell me . '' `` no . . . it 's okay . '' she took a shaky breath . `` my dad sent it to me folded up in a letter , two summers ago . the ring was , like , his main keepsake from athena . he would n't have gotten through his doctoral program at harvard with- out her . . . . that 's a long story . anyway , he said he wanted me to have it . he apologized for being a jerk , said he loved me and missed me . he wanted me to come home and live with him . '' `` that does n't sound so bad . '' `` yeah , well . . . the problem was , i believed him . i tried [ 250 ] to go home for that school year , but my stepmom was the same as ever . she did n't want her kids put in danger by liv- ing with a freak . monsters attacked . we argued . monsters attacked . we argued . i did n't even make it through winter break . i called chiron and came right back to camp half- blood . '' `` you think you 'll ever try living with your dad again ? '' she would n't meet my eyes . `` please . i 'm not into self- inflicted pain . '' `` you should n't give up , '' i told her . `` you should write him a letter or something . '' `` thanks for the advice , '' she said coldly , `` but my father 's made his choice about who he wants to live with. `` we passed another few miles of silence . `` so if the gods fight , '' i said , `` will things line up the way they did with the trojan war ? will it be athena versus poseidon ? '' she put her head against the backpack ares had given us , and closed her eyes . `` i do n't know what my mom will do . i just know i 'll fight next to you . '' `` why ? '' `` because you 're my friend , seaweed brain . any more stupid questions ? '' i could n't think of an answer for that . fortunately i did n't have to . annabeth was asleep . i had trouble following her example , with grover snoring and an albino lion staring hungrily at me , but even- tually i closed my eyes . [ 251 ] * * * my nightmare started out as something id dreamed a mil- lion times before : i was being forced to take a standardized test while wearing a straitjacket . all the other kids were going out to recess , and the teacher kept saying , come on , percy . you 're not stupid , are you ? pick up your pencil . then the dream strayed from the usual . i looked over at the next desk and saw a girl sitting there , also wearing a straitjacket . she was my age , with unruly black , punk-style hair , dark eyeliner around her stormy green eyes , and freckles across her nose . somehow , i knew who she was . she was thalia , daughter of zeus . she struggled against the straitjacket , glared at me in frustration , and snapped . well , seaweed brain ? one of us has to get out of here . she 's right , my dream-self thought . i 'm going back to that cavern . i 'm going to give hades a piece of my mind . the straitjacket melted off me . i fell through the class- room floor . the teacher 's voice changed until it was cold and evil , echoing from the depths of a great chasm . percy jackson , it said . yes , the exchange went well , i see . i was back in the dark cavern , spirits of the dead drift- ing around me . unseen in the pit , the monstrous thing was speaking , but this time it was n't addressing me . the numb- ing power of its voice seemed directed somewhere else . and he suspects nothing ? it asked . another voice , one i almost recognized , answered at my shoulder . nothing , my lord . he is as ignorant as the rest . [ 252 ] i looked over , but no one was there . the speaker was invisible . deception upon deception , the thing in the pit mused aloud . excellent . truly , my lord , said the voice next to me , you are well-named the crooked one . but was it really necessary ? i could have brought you what l stole directly — you ? the monster said in scorn . you have already shown your limits . you would have jailed me completely had i not intervened . but , my lord — peace , little serx ’ ant . our six months have bought us much . zeus 's anger has grown . poseidon has played his most desperate card . now we shall use it against him . shortly you shall have the reward you wish , and your revenge . as soon as both items are delivered into my hands . . . but wait . he is here . what ? the invisible servant suddenly sounded tense . you summoned him , my lord ? no . the full force of the monster 's attention was now pouring over me , freezing me in place . blast hisfather 's blood — he is too changeable , too unpredictable . the boy brought himself hither . impossible ! the servant cried . for a weakling such as you , perhaps , the voice snarled . then its cold power turned back on me . so .. . you wish to dream of your quest , young half-blood ? then i will oblige . the scene changed . i was standing in a vast throne room with black marble walls and bronze floors . the empty , horrid throne was made from human bones fused together . standing at the [ 253 ] foot of the dais was my mother , frozen in shimmering golden light , her arms outstretched . i tried to step toward her , but my legs would n't move . i reached for her , only to realize that my hands were wither- ing to bones . grinning skeletons in greek armor crowded around me , draping me with silk robes , wreathing my head with laurels that smoked with chimera poison , burning into my scalp . the evil voice began to laugh . hail , the conquering hero ! i woke with a start . grover was shaking my shoulder . `` the truck 's stopped , '' he said . `` we think they 're coming to check on the animals . '' `` hide ! '' annabeth hissed . she had it easy . she just put on her magic cap and dis- appeared . grover and i had to dive behind feed sacks and hope we looked like turnips . the trailer doors creaked open . sunlight and heat poured in . `` man ! '' one of the truckers said , waving his hand in front of his ugly nose . `` i wish i hauled appliances . '' he climbed inside and poured some water from a jug into the animals ' dishes . `` you hot , big boy ? '' he asked the lion , then splashed the rest of the bucket right in the lion 's face . the lion roared in indignation . `` yeah , yeah , yeah , '' the man said . next to me , under the turnip sacks , grover tensed . for a peace-loving herbivore , he looked downright murderous . [ 254 ] the trucker threw the antelope a squashed-looking happy meal bag . he smirked at the zebra . `` how ya doin ' . stripes ? least we 'll be getting rid of you this stop . you like magic shows ? you 're gon na love this one . they 're gon na saw you in half ! '' the zebra , wild-eyed with fear , looked straight at me . there was no sound , but as clear as day , i heard it say : free me , lord . please . i was too stunned to react . there was a loud knock , knock , knock on the side of the trailer . the trucker inside with us yelled , `` what do you want , eddie ? '' a voice outside — it must 've been eddie 's — shouted back , `` maurice ? what 'd ya say ? '' `` what are you banging for ? '' knock , knock , knock . outside , eddie yelled . `` what banging ? '' our guy maurice rolled his eyes and went back outside , cursing at eddie for being an idiot . a second later , annabeth appeared next to me . she must 've done the banging to get maurice out of the trailer . she said , `` this transport business ca n't be legal . '' `` no kidding , '' grover said . he paused , as if listening . `` the lion says these guys are animal smugglers ! '' that 's right , the zebra 's voice said in my mind . `` we 've got to free them ! '' grover said . he and annabeth both looked at me , waiting for my lead . i 'd heard the zebra talk , but not the lion . why ? maybe [ 255 ] it was another learning disability ... i could only under- stand zebras ? then i thought : horses . what had annabeth said about poseidon creating horses ? was a zebra close enough to a horse ? was that why i could understand it ? the zebra said , open my cage , lord . phase . i 'll be fine after that . outside , eddie and maurice were still yelling at each other , but i knew they 'd be coming inside to torment the animals again any minute . i grabbed riptide and slashed the lock off the zebra 's cage . the zebra burst out . it turned to me and bowed . thank you , lord . grover held up his hands and said something to the zebra in goat talk , like a blessing . just as maurice was poking his head back inside to check out the noise , the zebra leaped over him and into the street . there was yelling and screaming and cars honking . we rushed to the doors of the trailer in time to see the zebra gal- loping down a wide boulevard lined with hotels and casinos and neon signs . we 'd just released a zebra in las vegas . maurice and eddie ran after it , with a few policemen running after them , shouting , `` hey ! you need a permit for that ! `` `` now would be a good time to leave , '' annabeth said . `` the other animals first , '' grover said . i cut the locks with my sword . grover raised his hands and spoke the same goat-blessing he 'd used for the zebra . `` good luck , '' i told the animals . the antelope and the lion burst out of their cages and went off together into the streets . [ 256 ] some tourists screamed . most just backed off and took pictures , probably thinking it was some kind of stunt by one of the casinos . `` will the animals be okay ? '' i asked grover . `` i mean , the desert and all — `` '' do n't worry , '' he said . `` i placed a satyr 's sanctuary on them. `` `` meaning ? '' `` meaning they 'll reach the wild safely , '' he said . `` they 'll find water , food , shade , whatever they need until they find a safe place to live . '' `` why ca n't you place a blessing like that on us ? '' i asked . `` it only works on wild animals . '' `` so it would only affect percy , '' annabeth reasoned . `` hey ! '' i protested . `` kidding , '' she said . `` come on . let 's get out of this filthy truck . '' we stumbled out into the desert afternoon . it was a hundred and ten degrees , easy , and we must 've looked like deep-fried vagrants , but everybody was too interested in the wild animals to pay us much attention . we passed the monte carlo and the mgm . we passed pyramids , a pirate ship , and the statue of liberty , which was a pretty small replica , but still made me homesick . i was n't sure what we were looking for . maybe just a place to get out of the heat for a few minutes , find a sand- wich and a glass of lemonade , make a new plan for getting west . we must have taken a wrong turn , because we found [ 257 ] ourselves at a dead end , standing in front of the lotus hotel and casino . the entrance was a huge neon flower , the petals lighting up and blinking . no one was going in or out , but the glittering chrome doors were open , spilling out air- conditioning that smelled like flowers — lotus blossom , maybe . id never smelled one , so i was n't sure . the doorman smiled at us . `` hey , kids . you look tired . you want to come in and sit down ? '' i 'd learned to be suspicious , the last week or so . i figured anybody might be a monster or a god . you just could n't tell . but this guy was normal . one look at him , and i could see . besides , i was so relieved to hear somebody who sounded sympathetic that i nodded and said we 'd love to come in . inside , we took one look around , and grover said , '' whoa. ” the whole lobby was a giant game room . and i 'm not talking about cheesy old pac-man games or slot machines . there was an indoor waterslide snaking around the glass elevator , which went straight up at least forty floors . there was a climbing wall on the side of one building , and an indoor bungee-jumping bridge . there were virtual-reality suits with working laser guns . and hundreds of video games , each one the size of a widescreen tv basically , you name it , this place had it . there were a few other kids play- ing , but not that many . no waiting for any of the games . there were waitresses and snack bars all around , serving every kind of food you can imagine . `` hey ! '' a bellhop said . at least i guessed he was a bell- hop . he wore a white-and-yello w hawaiian shirt with lotus [ 258 ] designs , shorts , and flip-flops . `` welcome to the lotus casino . here 's your room key . '' i stammered , `` um , but . . . `` `` no , no , '' he said , laughing . `` the bill 's taken care of . no extra charges , no tips . just go on up to the top floor , room 4001. if you need anything , like extra bubbles for the hot tub , or skeet targets for the shooting range , or what- ever , just call the front desk . here are your lotuscash cards . they work in the restaurants and on all the games and rides . '' he handed us each a green plastic credit card . i knew there must be some mistake . obviously he thought we were some millionaire 's kids . but i took the card and said , `` how much is on here ? '' his eyebrows knit together . `` what do you mean ? '' `` i mean , when does it run out of cash ? '' he laughed . `` oh , you 're making a joke . hey , that 's cool . enjoy your stay . '' we took the elevator upstairs and checked out our room . it was a suite with three separate bedrooms and a bar stocked with candy , sodas , and chips . a hotline to room service . fluffy towels and water beds with feather pillows . a big-screen television with satellite and high-speed internet . the balcony had its own hot tub , and sure enough , there was a skeet-shooting machine and a shotgun , so you could launch clay pigeons right out over the las vegas skyline and plug them with your gun . i did n't see how that could be legal , but i thought it was pretty cool . the view over the strip and the desert was amazing , though i doubted [ 259 ] we 'd ever find time to look at the view with a room like this . `` oh , goodness , '' annabeth said . `` this place is . . . '' `` sweet , '' grover said . `` absolutely sweet . '' there were clothes in the closet , and they fit me . i frowned , thinking that this was a little strange . i threw ares 's backpack in the trash can . would n't need that anymore . when we left , i could just charge a new one at the hotel store . i took a shower , which felt awesome after a week of grimy travel . i changed clothes , ate a bag of chips , drank three cokes , and came out feeling better than i had in a long time . in the back of my mind , some small problem kept nagging me . i 'd had a dream or something ... i needed to talk to my friends . but i was sure it could wait . i came out of the bedroom and found that annabeth and grover had also showered and changed clothes . grover was eating potato chips to his heart 's content , while annabeth cranked up the national geographic channel . `` all those stations , '' i told her , `` and you turn on national geographic . are you insane ? '' `` it 's interesting . '' `` i feel good , '' grover said . `` i love this place . '' without his even realizing it , the wings sprouted out of his shoes and lifted him a foot off the ground , then back down again . `` so what now ? '' annabeth asked . `` sleep ? '' grover and i looked at each other and grinned . we both held up our green plastic lotuscash cards . [ 260 ] '' play time , '' i said . i could n't remember the last time i had so much fun . i came from a relatively poor family . our idea of a splurge was eating out at burger king and renting a video . a five- star vegas hotel ? forget it . i bungee-jumped the lobby five or six times , did the waterslide , snowboarded the artificial ski slope , and played virtual-reality laser tag and fbi sharpshooter . i saw grover a few times , going from game to game . he really liked the reverse hunter thing — where the deer go out and shoot the rednecks . i saw annabeth playing trivia games and other brainiac stuff . they had this huge 3-d sim game where you build your own city , and you could actually see the holographic buildings rise on the display board . i did n't think much of it , but annabeth loved it . i 'm not sure when i first realized something was wrong . probably , it was when i noticed the guy standing next to me atvr sharpshooters . he was about thirteen , i guess , but his clothes were weird . i thought he was some elvis imper- sonator 's son . he wore bell-bottom jeans and a red t-shirt with black piping , and his hair was permed and gelled like a new jersey girl 's on homecoming night . we played a game of sharpshooters together and he said , `` groovy , man . been here two weeks , and the games keep getting better and better . '' groovy ? later , while we were talking , i said something was '' sick , `` and he looked at me kind of startled , as if he 'd never heard the word used that way before . [ 261 ] he said his name was darrin , but as soon as i started asking him questions he got bored with me and started to go back to the computer screen . i said , `` hey , darrin ? '' `` what ? '' `` what year is it ? '' he frowned at me . `` in the game ? '' `` no . in real life . '' he had to think about it. `` 1977 . '' `` no , '' i said , getting a little scared . `` really . '' `` hey , man . bad vibes . i got a game happening . '' after that he totally ignored me . i started talking to people , and i found it was n't easy . they were glued to the tv screen , or the video game , or their food , or whatever . i found a guy who told me it was 1985. another guy told me it was 1993. they all claimed they had n't been in here very long , a few days , a few weeks at most . they did n't really know and they did n't care . then it occurred to me : how long had i been here ? it seemed like only a couple of hours , but was it ? i tried to remember why we were here . we were going to los angeles . we were supposed to find the entrance to the underworld . my mother . . . for a scary second , i had trou- ble remembering her name . sally . sally lackson . i had to find her . i had to stop hades from causing world war iii . i found annabeth still building her city . `` come on , '' i told her . `` we 've got to get out of here . '' no response . i shook her . `` annabeth ? '' [ 262 ] she looked up , annoyed . `` what ? '' `` we need to leave . '' `` leave ? what are you talking about ? i 've just got the towers — `` '' this place is a trap . '' she did n't respond until i shook her again . `` what ? '' `` listen . the underworld . our quest ! '' `` oh , come on , percy . just a few more minutes . '' `` annabeth , there are people here from 1977. kids who have never aged . you check in , and you stay forever . '' `` so ? '' she asked . `` can you imagine a better place ? '' i grabbed her wrist and yanked her away from the game . `` hey ! '' she screamed and hit me , but nobody else even bothered looking at us . they were too busy . i made her look directly in my eyes . i said , `` spiders . large , hairy spiders . '' that jarred her . her vision cleared . `` oh my gods , '' she said . `` how long have we — `` '' i do n't know , but we 've got to find grover . '' we went searching , and found him still playing virtual deer hunter . `` grover ! '' we both shouted . he said , `` die , human ! die , silly polluting nasty person ! `` `` grover ! `` he turned the plastic gun on me and started clicking , as if i were just another image from the screen . i looked at annabeth , and together we took grover by the arms and dragged him away . his flying shoes sprang to [ 263 ] life and started tugging his legs in the other direction as he shouted , `` no ! i just got to a new level ! no ! '' the lotus bellhop hurried up to us . `` well , now , are you ready for your platinum cards ? '' `` we 're leaving , '' i told him . `` such a shame , '' he said , and i got the feeling that he really meant it , that we 'd be breaking his heart if we went . `` we just added an entire new floor full of games for platinum-card members . '' he held out the cards , and i wanted one . i knew that if i took one . i 'd never leave . i 'd stay here , happy forever , play- ing games forever , and soon i 'd forget my mom , and my quest , and maybe even my own name . i 'd be playing virtual rifleman with groovy disco darrin forever . grover reached for the card , but annabeth yanked back his arm and said , `` no , thanks . '' we walked toward the door , and as we did , the smell of the food and the sounds of the games seemed to get more and more inviting . i thought about our room upstairs . we could just stay the night , sleep in a real bed for once . . . . then we burst through the doors of the lotus casino and ran down the sidewalk . it felt like afternoon , about the same time of day we 'd gone into the casino , but something was wrong . the weather had completely changed . it was stormy , with heat lightning flashing out in the desert . ares 's backpack was slung over my shoulder , which was odd , because i was sure i had thrown it in the trash can in room 400 1 , but at the moment i had other problems to worry about . [ 264 ] i ran to the nearest newspaper stand and read the year first . thank the gods , it was the same year it had been when we went in . then i noticed the date : june twentieth . we had been in the lotus casino for five days . we had only one day left until the summer solstice . one day to complete our quest . [ 265 ] 17 ♦ w€ shop for watcr b€ds it was annabeth 's idea . she loaded us into the back of a vegas taxi as if we actually had money , and told the driver , `` los angeles , please. `` the cabbie chewed his cigar and sized us up . `` that 's three hundred miles . for that , you got ta pay up front . '' `` you accept casino debit cards ? '' annabeth asked . he shrugged . `` some of 'em . same as credit cards . i got ta swipe 'em through first . '' annabeth handed him her green lotuscash card . he looked at it skeptically . `` swipe it , '' annabeth invited . he did . his meter machine started rattling . the lights flashed . finally an infinity symbol came up next to the dollar sign . the cigar fell out of the driver 's mouth . he looked back at us , his eyes wide . `` where to in los angeles . . . uh . your highness ? '' `` the santa monica pier . '' annabeth sat up a little straighter . i could tell she liked the `` your highness '' thing . `` get us there fast , and you can keep the change . '' [ 266 ] maybe she should n't have told him that . the cab 's speedometer never dipped below ninety-five the whole way through the mojave desert . on the road , we had plenty of time to talk . i told annabeth and grover about my latest dream , but the details got sketch- ier the more i tried to remember them . the lotus casino seemed to have short-circuited my memory . i could n't recall what the invisible servant 's voice had sounded like , though i was sure it was somebody i knew . the servant had called the monster in the pit something other than `` my lord '' ... some special name or title . . . . `` the silent one ? '' annabeth suggested . `` the rich one ? both of those are nicknames for hades . '' `` maybe ... '' i said , though neither sounded quite right . `` that throne room sounds like hades 's , '' grover said . `` that 's the way it 's usually described . '' i shook my head . `` something 's wrong . the throne room was n't the main part of the dream . and that voice from the pit ... i do n't know . it just did n't feel like a god 's voice . '' annabeth 's eyes widened . `` what ? '' i asked . `` oh . . . nothing . i was just — no , it has to be hades . maybe he sent this thief , this invisible person , to get the master bolt , and something went wrong — `` '' like what ? '' `` i — i do n't know , '' she said . `` but if he stole zeus 's sym- bol of power from olympus , and the gods were hunting [ 267 ] him , i mean , a lot of things could go wrong . so this thief had to hide the bolt , or he lost it somehow . anyway , he failed to bring it to hades . that 's what the voice said in your dream , right ? the guy failed . that would explain what the furies were searching for when they came after us on the bus . maybe they thought we had retrieved the bolt . '' i was n't sure what was wrong with her . she looked pale . `` but if i 'd already retrieved the bolt , '' i said , `` why would i be traveling to the underworld ? '' `` to threaten hades , '' grover suggested . `` to bribe or blackmail him into getting your mom back . '' i whistled . `` you have evil thoughts for a goat . '' `` why , thank you . '' `` but the thing in the pit said it was waiting for two items , '' i said . `` if the master bolt is one , what 's the other ? '' grover shook his head , clearly mystified . annabeth was looking at me as if she knew my next question , and was silently willing me not to ask it . `` you have an idea what might be in that pit , do n't you ? '' i asked her . `` i mean , if it is n't hades ? '' `` percy . . . let 's not talk about it . because if it is n't hades . . . no . it has to be hades . '' wasteland rolled by . we passed a sign that said cali- fornia state line , 12 miles . i got the feeling i was missing one simple , critical piece of information . it was like when i stared at a common word i should know , but i could n't make sense of it because one or two letters were floating around . the more i thought about my quest , the more i was sure that confronting hades [ 268 ] was n't the real answer . there was something else going on , something even more dangerous . the problem was : we were hurtling toward the underworld at ninety-five miles an hour , betting that hades had the master bolt . if we got there and found out we were wrong , we would n't have time to correct ourselves . the sol- stice deadline would pass and war would begin . `` the answer is in the underworld , '' annabeth assured me . `` you saw spirits of the dead , percy . there 's only one place that could be . we 're doing the right thing . '' she tried to boost our morale by suggesting clever strategies for getting into the land of the dead , but my heart was n't in it . there were just too many unknown fac- tors . it was like cramming for a test without knowing the subject . and believe me , i 'd done that enough times . the cab sped west . every gust of wind through death valley sounded like a spirit of the dead . every time the brakes hissed on an eighteen-wheeler , it reminded me of echidna 's reptilian voice . at sunset , the taxi dropped us at the beach in santa monica . it looked exactly the way l.a. beaches do in the movies , only it smelled worse . there were carnival rides lining the pier , palm trees lining the sidewalks , homeless guys sleeping in the sand dunes , and surfer dudes waiting for the perfect wave . grover , annabeth , and i walked down to the edge of the surf . `` what now ? '' annabeth asked . [ 269 ] the pacific was turning gold in the setting sun . i thought about how long it had been since id stood on the beach at mont auk , on the opposite side of the country , looking out at a different sea . how could there be a god who could control all that ? what did my science teacher used to say — two-thirds of the earth 's surface was covered in water ? how could i be the son of someone that powerful ? i stepped into the surf '' percy ? '' annabeth said . `` what are you doing ? '' i kept walking , up to my waist , then my chest . she called after me , `` you know how polluted that water is ? there 're all kinds of toxic — `` that 's when my head went under . i held my breath at first . it 's difficult to intentionally inhale water . finally i could n't stand it anymore . i gasped . sure enough , i could breathe normally . i walked down into the shoals . i should n't have been able to see through the murk , but somehow i could tell where everything was . i could sense the rolling texture of the bottom . i could make out sand-dollar colonies dotting the sandbars . i could even see the currents , warm and cold streams swirling together . i felt something rub against my leg . i looked down and almost shot out of the water like a ballistic missile . sliding along beside me was a five-foot-long rnako shark . but the thing was n't attacking . it was nuzzling me . heeling like a dog . tentatively , i touched its dorsal fin . it bucked a little , as if inviting me to hold tighter . i grabbed [ 270 ] the fin with both hands . it took off , pulling me along . the shark carried me down into the darkness . it deposited me at the edge of the ocean proper , where the sand bank dropped off into a huge chasm . it was like standing on the rim of the grand canyon at midnight , not being able to see much , but knowing the void was right there . the surface shimmered maybe a hundred and fifty feet above . i knew i should 've been crushed by the pressure . then again , i should n't have been able to breathe . i won- dered if there was a limit to how deep i could go , if i could sink straight to the bottom of the pacific . then i saw something glimmering in the darkness below , growing bigger and brighter as it rose toward me . a woman 's voice , like my mother 's , called : `` percy jackson . '' as she got closer , her shape became clearer . she had flowing black hair , a dress made of green silk . light flick- ered around her , and her eyes were so distractingly beautiful i hardly noticed the stallion-sized sea horse she was riding . she dismounted . the sea horse and the rnako shark whisked off and started playing something that looked like tag . the underwater lady smiled at me . `` you 've come far , percy jackson . well done . '' i was n't quite sure what to do , so i bowed . `` you 're the woman who spoke to me in the mississippi river . '' `` yes , child . i am a nereid , a spirit of the sea . it was not easy to appear so far upriver , but the naiads , my freshwater cousins , helped sustain my life force . they honor lord poseidon , though they do not serve in his court . '' `` and . . . you serve in poseidon 's court ? '' [ 271 ] she nodded . `` it has been many years since a child of the sea god has been born . we have watched you with great interest. `` suddenly i remembered faces in the waves off montauk beach when i was a little boy , reflections of smiling women . like so many of the weird things in my life , id never given it much thought before . `` if my father is so interested in me , '' i said , `` why is n't he here ? why does n't he speak to me ? '' a cold current rose out of the depths . `` do not judge the lord of the sea too harshly , '' the nereid told me . `` he stands at the brink of an unwanted war . he has much to occupy his time . besides , he is forbid- den to help you directly . the gods may not show such favoritism . '' `` even to their own children ? '' `` especially to them . the gods can work by indirect influence only . that is why i give you a warning , and a gift . '' she held out her hand . three white pearls flashed in her palm . `` i know you journey to hades 's realm , '' she said . `` few mortals have ever done this and survived : orpheus , who had great music skill ; hercules , who had great strength ; houdini , who could escape even the depths oftartarus . do you have these talents ? '' `` u m . . . no , ma'am. `` `` ah , but you have something else , percy . you have gifts you have only begun to know . the oracles have foretold a [ 272 ] great and terrible future for you . should you survive to man- hood . poseidon would not have you die before your time . therefore take these , and when you are in need , smash a pearl at your feet . '' `` what will happen ? '' `` that , '' she said , `` depends on the need . but remember : what belongs to the sea will always return to the sea . '' `` what about the warning ? '' her eyes flickered with green light . `` go with what your heart tells you , or you will lose all . hades feeds on doubt and hopelessness . he will trick you if he can . make you mis- trust your own judgment . once you are in his realm , he will never willingly let you leave . keep faith . good luck , percy jackson. `` she summoned her sea horse and rode toward the void . `` wait ! '' i called . `` at the river , you said not to trust the gifts . what gifts ? '' `` good-bye , young hero , '' she called back , her voice fad- ing into the depths . `` you must listen to your heart. ” she became a speck of glowing green , and then she was gone . i wanted to follow her down into the darkness . i wanted to see the court of poseidon . but i looked up at the sunset darkening on the surface . my friends were waiting . we had so little time . . . . i kicked upward toward the shore . when i reached the beach , my clothes dried instantly . i told grover and annabeth what had happened , and showed them the pearls . annabeth grimaced . `` no gift comes without a price . '' [ 273 ] '' they were free . '' `` no . '' she shook her head. `` 'there is no such thing as a free lunch . ' that 's an ancient greek saying that translated pretty well into american . there will be a price . you wait . '' on that happy thought , we turned our backs on the sea . with some spare change from ares 's backpack , we took the bus into west hollywood . i showed the driver the underworld address slip i 'd taken from aunty em 's garden gnome emporium , but he 'd never heard of doa recording studios . `` you remind me of somebody i saw ontv , '' he told me . `` you a child actor or something ? '' `` uh ... i 'm a stunt double ... for a lot of child actors . '' `` oh ! that explains it . '' we thanked him and got off quickly at the next stop . we wandered for miles on foot , looking for doa . nobody seemed to know where it was . it did n't appear in the phone book . twice , we ducked into alleys to avoid cop cars . i froze in front of an appliance-store window because a television was playing an interview with somebody who looked very familiar — my stepdad . smelly gabe . he was talking to barbara walters — i mean , as if he were some kind of huge celebrity . she was interviewing him in our apartment , in the middle of a poker game , and there was a young blond lady sitting next to him , patting his hand . a fake tear glistened on his cheek . he was saying , '' honest , ms. walters , if it was n't for sugar here , my grief [ 274 ] counselor . i 'd be a wreck . my stepson took everything i cared about . my wife . . . my camaro . . . i — i 'm sorry . i have trouble talking about it . '' `` there you have it , america . '' barbara walters turned to the camera . `` a man torn apart . an adolescent boy with seri- ous issues . let me show you , again , the last known photo of this troubled young fugitive , taken a week ago in denver . '' the screen cut to a grainy shot of me , annabeth , and grover standing outside the colorado diner , talking to ares . `` who are the other children in this photo ? '' barbara walters asked dramatically . `` who is the man with them ? is percy jackson a delinquent , a terrorist , or perhaps the brainwashed victim of a frightening new cult ? when we come back , we chat with a leading child psychologist . stay tuned , america . '' `` c'mon , '' grover told me . he hauled me away before i could punch a hole in the appliance-store window . it got dark , and hungry-looking characters started coming out on the streets to play . now , do n't get me wrong . i 'm a new yorker . i do n't scare easy . but l.a. had a totally different feel from new york . back home , everything seemed close . it did n't matter how big the city was , you could get anywhere without getting lost . the street pattern and the subway made sense . there was a system to how things worked . a kid could be safe as long as he was n't stupid . l.a. was n't like that . it was spread out , chaotic , hard to move around . it reminded me of ares . it was n't enough for [ 275 ] l.a. to be big ; it had to prove it was big by being loud and strange and difficult to navigate , too . i did n't know how we were ever going to find the entrance to the underworld by tomorrow , the summer solstice . we walked past gangbangers , bums , and street hawkers , who looked at us like they were trying to figure if we were worth the trouble of mugging . as we hurried passed the entrance of an alley , a voice from the darkness said , `` hey , you . '' like an idiot . i stopped . before i knew it , we were surrounded . a gang of kids had circled us . six of them in all — white kids with expen- sive clothes and mean faces . like the kids at yancy academy : rich brats playing at being bad boys . instinctively , i uncapped riptide . when the sword appeared out of nowhere , the kids backed off , but their leader was either really stupid or really brave , because he kept coming at me with a switchblade . i made the mistake of swinging . the kid yelped . but he must 've been one hundred per- cent mortal , because the blade passed harmlessly right through his chest . he looked down . `` what the . . . '' i figured i had about three seconds before his shock turned to anger . `` run ! '' i screamed at annabeth and grover . we pushed two kids out of the way and raced down the street , not knowing where we were going . we turned a sharp corner . `` there ! '' annabeth shouted . [ 2761 only one store on the block looked open , its windows glaring with neon . the sign above the door said something like crstuy 's watre bde alpace . `` crusty 's water bed palace ? '' grover translated . it did n't sound like a place i 'd ever go except in an emer- gency , but this definitely qualified . we burst through the doors , ran behind a water bed , and ducked . a split second later , the gang kids ran past outside . `` i think we lost them , '' grover panted . a voice behind us boomed , `` lost who ? '' we all jumped . standing behind us was a guy who looked like a raptor in a leisure suit . he was at least seven feet tall , with absolutely no hair . he had gray , leathery skin , thick-lidded eyes , and a cold , reptilian smile . he moved toward us slowly , but i got the feeling he could move fast if he needed to . his suit might 've come from the lotus casino . it belonged back in the seventies , big-time . the shirt was silk paisley , unbuttoned halfway down his hairless chest . the lapels on his velvet jacket were as wide as landing strips . the silver chains around his neck — i could n't even count them . `` i 'm crusty , '' he said , with a tartar-yellow smile . i resisted the urge to say . yes , you are . `` sorry to barge in , '' i told him . `` we were just , um , browsing. `` `` you mean hiding from those no-good kids , '' he grum- bled . `` they hang around every night . i get a lot of people in here , thanks to them . say , you want to look at a water bed ? '' [ 277 ] i was about to say no , thanks , when he put a huge paw on my shoulder and steered me deeper into the showroom . there was every kind of water bed you could imagine : different kinds of wood , different patterns of sheets ; queen-size , king-size , emperor-of-the- universe-size . `` this is my most popular model . '' crusty spread his hands proudly over a bed covered with black satin sheets , with built-in lava lamps on the headboard . the mattress vibrated , so it looked like oil-flavored jell-o . `` million-hand massage , '' crusty told us . `` go on , try it out . shoot , take a nap . i do n't care . no business today , any- way . '' `` um , '' i said . `` i do n't think . . . '' `` million-hand massage ! '' grover cried , and dove in . `` oh , you guys ! this is cool . '' `` hmm , '' crusty said , stroking his leathery chin . `` almost , almost . '' `` almost what ? '' i asked . he looked at annabeth . `` do me a favor and try this one over here , honey . might fit . '' annabeth said , `` but what — `` he patted her reassuringly on the shoulder and led her over to the safari deluxe model with teakwood lions carved into the frame and a leopard-patterned comforter . when annabeth did n't want to lie down . crusty pushed her . `` hey ! '' she protested . crusty snapped his fingers . `` ergo ! '' ropes sprang from the sides of the bed , lashing around annabeth , holding her to the mattress . [ 278 ] grover tried to get up , but ropes sprang from his black- satin bed , too , and lashed him down . `` n-not c-c-cool ! '' he yelled , his voice vibrating from the million-hand massage . `` n-not c-cool a-at all ! '' the giant looked at annabeth , then turned toward me and grinned . `` almost , darn it . '' i tried to step away , but his hand shot out and clamped around the back of my neck . `` whoa , kid . do n't worry . we 'll find you one in a sec . '' `` let my friends go . '' `` oh , sure i will . but i got to make them fit , first . '' `` what do you mean ? '' `` all the beds are exactly six feet , see ? your friends are too short . got to make them fit . '' annabeth and grover kept struggling . `` ca n't stand imperfect measurements , '' crusty mut- tered . `` ergo ! '' a new set of ropes leaped out from the top and bottom of the beds , wrapping around grover and annabeth 's ankles , then around their armpits . the ropes started tight- ening , pulling my friends from both ends . `` do n't worry , '' crusty told me . `` these are stretching jobs . maybe three extra inches on their spines . they might even live . now why do n't we find a bed you like , huh ? '' `` percy ! '' grover yelled . my mind was racing . i knew i could n't take on this giant water-bed salesman alone . he would snap my neck before i ever got my sword out . `` your real name 's not crusty , is it ? '' i asked . [ 279 ] '' legally , it 's procrustes , '' he admitted . `` the stretcher , '' i said . i remembered the story : the giant who 'd tried to kill theseus with excess hospitality on his way to athens . `` yeah , '' the salesman said . `` but who can pronounce procrustes ? bad for business . now 'crusty , ' anybody can say that . '' `` you 're right . it 's got a good ring to it . '' his eyes lit up . `` you think so ? '' `` oh , absolutely , '' i said . `` and the workmanship on these beds ? fabulous ! '' he grinned hugely , but his fingers did n't loosen on my neck . `` i tell my customers that . every time . nobody bothers to look at the workmanship . how many built-in lava lamp headboards have you seen ? '' `` not too many . '' `` that 's right ! '' `` percy ! '' annabeth yelled . `` what are you doing ? '' `` do n't mind her , '' i told procrustes . `` she 's impossible . '' the giant laughed . `` all my customers are . never six feet exactly . so inconsiderate . and then they complain about the fitting . '' `` what do you do if they 're longer than six feet ? '' `` oh , that happens all the time . it 's a simple fix . '' he let go of my neck , but before i could react , he reached behind a nearby sales desk and brought out a huge double-bladed brass axe . he said , `` i just center the sub- ject as best i can and lop off whatever hangs over on either end. `` [ 280 ] '' ah , '' i said , swallowing hard . `` sensible . '' `` i 'm so glad to come across an intelligent customer ! '' the ropes were really stretching my friends now . annabeth was turning pale . grover made gurgling sounds , like a strangled goose . `` so , crusty ... '' i said , trying to keep my voice light . i glanced at the sales tag on the valentine-shaped honeymoon special . `` does this one really have dynamic stabilizers to stop wave motion ? '' `` absolutely . try it out . '' `` yeah , maybe i will . but would it work even for a big guy like you ? no waves at all ? '' `` guaranteed. `` `` no way . '' `` way . '' `` show me . '' he sat down eagerly on the bed , patted the mattress . `` no waves . see ? '' i snapped my fingers . `` ergo . '' ropes lashed around crusty and flattened him against the mattress . `` hey ! '' he yelled . `` center him just right , '' i said . the ropes readjusted themselves at my command . crusty s whole head stuck out the top . his feet stuck out the bottom . `` no ! '' he said . `` wait ! this is just a demo . '' i uncapped riptide . `` a few simple adjustments . . . '' i had no qualms about what i was about to do . if [ 281 ] crusty were human , i could n't hurt him anyway . if he was a monster , he deserved to turn into dust for a while . `` you drive a hard bargain , '' he told me . `` i 'll give you thirty percent off on selected floor models ! '' `` i think i 'll start with the top . '' i raised my sword . `` no money down ! no interest for six months ! '' i swung the sword . crusty stopped making offers . i cut the ropes on the other beds . annabeth and grover got to their feet , groaning and wincing and cursing me a lot . `` you look taller , '' i said . `` very funny . '' annabeth said . `` be faster next time . '' i looked at the bulletin board behind crusty 's sales desk . there was an advertisement for hermes delivery service , and another for the all-new compendium of l.a. area monsters — `` the only monstrous yellow pages you 'll ever need ! '' under that , a bright orange flier for doa recording studios , offering commissions for heroes ' souls . `` we are always looking for new talent ! '' doas address was right underneath with a map . `` come on , '' i told my friends . `` give us a minute , '' grover complained . `` we were almost stretched to death ! '' `` then you 're ready for the underworld , '' i said . `` it 's only a block from here . '' [ 282 ] , 8 l annabcth docs f obcdicncc school we stood in the shadows of valencia boulevard , looking up at gold letters etched in black marble : doa recording studios . underneath , stenciled on the glass doors : no solici- tors . no loitering . no living . it was almost midnight , but the lobby was brightly lit and full of people . behind the security desk sat a tough- looking guard with sunglasses and an earpiece . i turned to my friends . `` okay . you remember the plan . '' `` the plan , '' grover gulped . `` yeah . i love the plan . '' annabeth said , `` what happens if the plan does n't work ? '' `` do n't think negative . '' `` right , '' she said . `` we 're entering the land of the dead , and i should n't think negative . '' i took the pearls out of my pocket , the three milky spheres the nereid had given me in santa monica . they did n't seem like much of a backup in case something went wrong . annabeth put her hand on my shoulder . `` i 'm sorry , percy . you 're right , we 'll make it . it 'll be fine . '' she gave grover a nudge . [ 283 ] '' oh , right . `` ’ he chimed in . `` we got this far . we 'll find the master bolt and save your mom . no problem . '' i looked at them both , and felt really grateful . only a few minutes before . i 'd almost gotten them stretched to death on deluxe water beds , and now they were trying to be brave for my sake , trying to make me feel better . i slipped the pearls back in my pocket . `` let 's whup some underworld butt . '' we walked inside the doa lobby . muzak played softly on hidden speakers . the carpet and walls were steel gray . pencil cactuses grew in the corners like skeleton hands . the furniture was black leather , and every seat was taken . there were people sitting on couches , people standing up , people staring out the windows or wait- ing for the elevator . nobody moved , or talked , or did much of anything . out of the corner of my eye , i could see them all just fine , but if i focused on any one of them in partic- ular , they started looking . . . transparent . i could see right through their bodies . the security guard 's desk was a raised podium , so we had to look up at him . he was tall and elegant , with chocolate-colored skin and bleached-blond hair shaved military style . he wore tortoiseshell shades and a silk italian suit that matched his hair . a black rose was pinned to his lapel under a silver name tag . i read the name tag , then looked at him in bewilder- ment . `` your name is chiron ? '' he leaned across the desk . i could n't see anything in his [ 284 ] glasses except my own reflection , but his smile was sweet and cold , like a python 's , right before it eats you . `` what a precious young lad . '' he had a strange accent — british , maybe , but also as if he had learned english as a second language . `` tell me , mate , do i look like a centaur ? '' `` n-no . '' `` sir , '' he added smoothly . `` sir , '' i said . he pinched the name tag and ran his finger under the letters . `` can you read this , mate ? it says c-h-a-r-o-n. say it with me : care-on . '' `` charon. `` `` amazing ! now : mr . charon . '' `` mr . charon . '' i said . `` well done . '' he sat back . `` i hate being confused with that old horse -man . and now , how may i help you little dead ones ? '' his question caught in my stomach like a fastball . i looked at annabeth for support . `` we want to go the underworld , '' she said . charon 's mouth twitched . `` well , that 's refreshing . '' `` it is ? '' she asked . `` straightforward and honest . no screaming . no 'there must be a mistake , mr . charon . ' `` he looked us over . `` how did you die , then ? '' i nudged grover . `` oh , '' he said . `` um . . . drowned ... in the bathtub . '' `` all three of you ? '' charon asked . [ 285 ] we nodded . `` big bathtub . '' charon looked mildly impressed . `` i do n't suppose you have coins for passage . normally , with adults , you see , i could charge your american express , or add the ferry price to your last cable bill . but with children . . . alas , you never die prepared . suppose you 'll have to take a seat for a few centuries . '' `` oh , but we have coins . '' i set three golden drachmas on the counter , part of the stash i 'd found in crusty 's office desk . `` well , now . . . '' charon moistened his lips . `` real drach- mas . real golden drachmas . i have n't seen these in . . . '' his fingers hovered greedily over the coins . we were so close . then charon looked at me . that cold stare behind his glasses seemed to bore a hole through my chest . `` here now , '' he said . `` you could n't read my name correctly . are you dyslexic , lad ? '' `` no , '' i said . `` i 'm dead . '' charon leaned forward and took a sniff . `` you 're not dead . i should 've known . you 're a godling . '' `` we have to get to the underworld , '' i insisted . charon made a growling sound deep in his throat . immediately , all the people in the waiting room got up and started pacing , agitated , lighting cigarettes , running hands through their hair , or checking their wristwatches . `` leave while you can , '' charon told us . `` i 'll just take these and forget i saw you . '' he started to go for the coins , but i snatched them back . [ 286 ] '' no service , no tip . '' i tried to sound braver than i felt . charon growled again — a deep , blood-chilling sound . the spirits of the dead started pounding on the elevator doors . `` it 's a shame , too , '' i sighed . `` we had more to offer . '' i held up the entire bag from crusty 's stash . i took out a fistful of drachmas and let the coins spill through my fingers . charon 's growl changed into something more like a lion 's purr . `` do you think i can be bought , godling ? eh . . . just out of curiosity , how much have you got there ? '' `` a lot , '' i said . `` i bet hades does n't pay you well enough for such hard work . '' `` oh , you do n't know the half of it . how would you like to babysit these spirits all day ? always 'please do n't let me be dead ' or 'please let me across for free . ' i have n't had a pay raise in three thousand years . do you imagine suits like this come cheap ? '' `` you deserve better , '' i agreed . `` a little appreciation . respect . good pay . '' with each word , i stacked another gold coin on the counter . charon glanced down at his silk italian jacket , as if imagining himself in something even better . `` i must say , lad , you 're making some sense now . just a little . '' i stacked another few coins . `` i could mention a pay raise while i 'm talking to hades . '' he sighed . `` the boat 's almost full , anyway . i might as well add you three and be off . '' [ 287 ] he stood , scooped up our money , and said , `` come along . we pushed through the crowd of waiting spirits , who started grabbing at our clothes like the wind , their voices whispering things i could n't make out . charon shoved them out of the way , grumbling , `` freeloaders . '' he escorted us into the elevator , which was already crowded with souls of the dead , each one holding a green boarding pass . charon grabbed two spirits who were trying to get on with us and pushed them back into the lobby . `` right . now , no one get any ideas while i 'm gone , '' he announced to the waiting room . `` and if anyone moves the dial off my easy-listening station again , i 'll make sure you 're here for another thousand years . understand ? '' he shut the doors . he put a key card into a slot in the elevator panel and we started to descend . `` what happens to the spirits waiting in the lobby ? '' annabeth asked . `` nothing , '' charon said . `` for how long ? '' `` forever , or until i 'm feeling generous . '' `` oh , '' she said . `` that 's . . . fair . '' charon raised an eyebrow . `` whoever said death was fair , young miss ? wait until it 's your turn . you 'll die soon enough , where you 're going . '' `` we 'll get out alive , '' i said . `` ha . '' i got a sudden dizzy feeling . we were n't going down [ 288 ] anymore , but forward . the air turned misty . spirits around me started changing shape . their modern clothes flickered , turning into gray hooded robes . the floor of the elevator began swaying . i blinked hard . when i opened my eyes , charon 's creamy italian suit had been replaced by a long black robe . his tortoiseshell glasses were gone . where his eyes should 've been were empty sockets — like ares 's eyes , except charon 's were totally dark , full of night and death and despair . he saw me looking , and said , `` well ? '' `` nothing , '' i managed . i thought he was grinning , but that was n't it . the flesh of his face was becoming transparent , letting me see straight through to his skull . the floor kept swaying . grover said , `` i think i 'm getting seasick . '' when i blinked again , the elevator was n't an elevator anymore . we were standing in a wooden barge . charon was poling us across a dark , oily river , swirling with bones , dead fish , and other , stranger things — plastic dolls , crushed car- nations , soggy diplomas with gilt edges . `` the river styx , '' annabeth murmured . `` it 's so . . . '' `` polluted , '' charon said . `` for thousands of years , you humans have been throwing in everything as you come across — hopes , dreams , wishes that never came true . irresponsible waste management , if you ask me . '' mist curled off the filthy water . above us , almost lost in the gloom , was a ceiling of stalactites . ahead , the [ 289 ] far shore glimmered with greenish light , the color of poison . panic closed up my throat . what was i doing here ? these people around me . . . they were dead . annabeth grabbed hold of my hand . under normal cir- cumstances , this would 've embarrassed me , but i under- stood how she felt . she wanted reassurance that somebody else was alive on this boat . i found myself muttering a prayer , though i was n't quite sure who i was praying to . down here , only one god mat- tered , and he was the one i had come to confront . the shoreline of the underworld came into view . craggy rocks and black volcanic sand stretched inland about a hundred yards to the base of a high stone wall , which marched off in either direction as far as we could see . a sound came from somewhere nearby in the green gloom , echoing off the stones — the howl of a large animal . `` old three-face is hungry , '' charon said . his smile turned skeletal in the greenish light . `` bad luck for you , godlings. `` the bottom of our boat slid onto the black sand . the dead began to disembark . a woman holding a little girl 's hand . an old man and an old woman hobbling along arm in arm . a boy no older than i was , shuffling silently along in his gray robe . charon said , `` i 'd wish you luck , mate , but there is n't any down here . mind you , do n't forget to mention my pay raise. `` he counted our golden coins into his pouch , then took [ 290 ] up his pole . he warbled something that sounded like a barry manilow song as he ferried the empty barge back across the river . we followed the spirits up a well-worn path . i 'm not sure what i was expecting — pearly gates , or a big black portcullis , or something . but the entrance to the underworld looked like a cross between airport security and the jersey turnpike . there were three separate entrances under one huge black archway that said you are now entering erebus . each entrance had a pass-through metal detector with secu- rity cameras mounted on top . beyond this were tollbooths manned by black-robed ghouls like charon . the howling of the hungry animal was really loud now , but i could n't see where it was coming from . the three- headed dog , cerberus , who was supposed to guard hades 's door , was nowhere to be seen . the dead queued up in the three lines , two marked attendant on duty , and one marked ez death . the ez death line was moving right along . the other two were crawling . `` what do you figure ? '' i asked annabeth . `` the fast line must go straight to the asphodel fields , '' she said . `` no contest . they do n't want to risk judgment from the court , because it might go against them . '' `` there 's a court for dead people ? '' `` yeah . three judges . they switch around who sits on the bench . king minos . thomas jefferson , shakespeare — [ 291 ] people like that . sometimes they look at a life and decide that person needs a special reward — the fields of elysium . sometimes they decide on punishment . but most people , well , they just lived . nothing special , good or bad . so they go to the asphodel fields . '' `` and do what ? '' grover said , `` imagine standing in a wheat field in kansas . forever . '' `` flarsh , '' i said . `` not as harsh as that , '' grover muttered . `` look . '' a couple of black-robbed ghouls had pulled aside one spirit and were frisking him at the security desk . the face of the dead man looked vaguely familiar . `` he 's that preacher who made the news , remember ? '' grover asked . `` oh , yeah . '' i did remember now . we 'd seen him on tv a couple of times at the yancy academy dorm . he was this annoying televangelist from upstate new york who 'd raised millions of dollars for orphanages and then got caught spending the money on stuff for his mansion , like gold- plated toilet seats , and an indoor putt-putt golf course . he 'd died in a police chase when his `` lamborghini for the lord '' went off a cliff . i said , `` what 're they doing to him ? '' `` special punishment from hades , '' grover guessed . `` the really bad people get his personal attention as soon as they arrive . the fur — the kindly ones will set up an eter- nal torture for him . '' the thought of the furies made me shudder . i realized [ 292 ] i was in their home territory now . old mrs. dodds would be licking her lips with anticipation . `` but if he 's a preacher , '' i said , `` and he believes in a dif- ferent hell . . . . '' grover shrugged . `` who says he 's seeing this place the way we 're seeing it ? humans see what they want to see . you 're very stubborn — er , persistent , that way . '' we got closer to the gates . the howling was so loud now it shook the ground at my feet , but i still could n't fig- ure out where it was coming from . then , about fifty feet in front of us , the green mist shimmered . standing just where the path split into three lanes was an enormous shadowy monster . i had n't seen it before because it was half transparent , like the dead . until it moved , it blended with whatever was behind it . only its eyes and teeth looked solid . and it was staring straight at me . my jaw hung open . all i could think to say was , `` he 's a rottweiler . '' i 'd always imagined cerberus as a big black mastiff . but he was obviously a purebred rottweiler , except of course that he was twice the size of a woolly mammoth , mostly invisible , and had three heads . the dead walked right up to him — no fear at all . the attendant on duty lines parted on either side of him . the ez death spirits walked right between his front paws and under his belly , which they could do without even crouching . `` i 'm starting to see him better , '' i muttered . `` why is that ? '' [ 293 ] '' i think . . annabeth moistened her lips . `` i 'm afraid it 's because we 're getting closer to being dead . '' the dog 's middle head craned toward us . it sniffed the air and growled . `` it can smell the living , '' i said . `` but that 's okay , '' grover said , trembling next to me . `` because we have a plan . '' `` right , '' annabeth said . i 'd never heard her voice sound quite so small . `` a plan . '' we moved toward the monster . the middle head snarled at us , then barked so loud my eyeballs rattled . `` can you understand it ? '' i asked grover . `` oh yeah , '' he said . `` i can understand it . '' `` what 's it saying ? '' `` i do n't think humans have a four-letter word that translates , exactly . '' i took the big stick out of my backpack — a bedpost i 'd broken off crusty 's safari deluxe floor model . i held it up , and tried to channel happy dog thoughts toward cerberus — alpo commercials , cute little pup- pies , fire hydrants . i tried to smile , like i was n't about to die . `` hey , big fella , '' i called up . `` i bet they do n't play with you much. ” '' gro wwwllll ! `` `` good boy , '' i said weakly . i waved the stick . the dog 's middle head followed the movement . the other two heads trained their eyes on [ 294 ] me , completely ignoring the spirits . i had cerberuss undi- vided attention . i was n't sure that was a good thing . `` fetch ! '' i threw the stick into the gloom , a good solid throw . i heard it go ker-sploosh in the river styx . cerberus glared at me , unimpressed . his eyes were bale- ful and cold . so much for the plan . cerberus was now making a new kind of growl , deeper down in his three throats . `` um , '' grover said . `` percy ? '' `` yeah ? '' `` i just thought you 'd want to know . '' `` yeah ? '' `` cerberus ? he 's saying we 've got ten seconds to pray to the god of our choice . after that . . . well . . . he 's hungry . '' `` wait ! '' annabeth said . she started rifling through her pack . uh-oh , i thought . `` five seconds , '' grover said . `` do we run now ? '' annabeth produced a red rubber ball the size of a grapefruit . it was labeled waterland , denver , co. before i could stop her , she raised the ball and marched straight up to cerberus . she shouted , `` see the ball ? you want the ball , cerberus ? sit ! '' cerberus looked as stunned as we were . all three of his heads cocked sideways . six nostrils dilated . `` sit ! '' annabeth called again . [ 295 ] i was sure that any moment she would become the world 's largest milkbone dog biscuit . but instead , cerberus licked his three sets of lips , shifted on his haunches , and sat , immediately crushing a dozen spirits who 'd been passing underneath him in the ez death line . the spirits made muffled hisses as they dissi- pated , like the air let out of tires . annabeth said , `` good boy ! '' she threw cerberus the ball . he caught it in his middle mouth . it was barely big enough for him to chew , and the other heads started snap- ping at the middle , trying to get the new toy . `` drop it ! '' annabeth ordered . cerberus 's heads stopped fighting and looked at her . the ball was wedged between two of his teeth like a tiny piece of gum . he made a loud , scary whimper , then dropped the ball , now slimy and bitten nearly in half , at annabeth 's feet . `` good boy . '' she picked up the ball , ignoring the mon- ster spit all over it . she turned toward us . `` go now . ez death line — it 's faster . '' i said , `` but — `` '' now ! '' she ordered , in the same tone she was using on the dog . grover and i inched forward warily . cerberus started to growl . `` stay ! '' annabeth ordered the monster . `` if you want the ball , stay ! '' cerberus whimpered , but he stayed where he was . [ 296 ] '' what about you ? '' i asked annabeth as we passed her . `` i know what i 'm doing , percy , '' she muttered . `` at least , i 'm pretty sure . . . . '' grover and i walked between the monster 's legs . please , annabeth , i prayed . do n't tell him to sit again . we made it through . cerberus was n't any less scary- looking from the back . annabeth said , `` good dog ! '' she held up the tattered red ball , and probably came to the same conclusion i did — if she rewarded cerberus , there 'd be nothing left for another trick . she threw the ball anyway . the monster 's left mouth immediately snatched it up , only to be attacked by the mid- dle head , while the right head moaned in protest . while the monster was distracted , annabeth walked briskly under its belly and joined us at the metal detector . `` how did you do that ? '' i asked her , amazed . `` obedience school , '' she said breathlessly , and i was sur- prised to see there were tears in her eyes . `` when i was little , at my dad 's house , we had a doberman . . . . '' `` never mind that , '' grover said , tugging at my shirt . `` come on ! '' we were about to bolt through the ez death line when cerberus moaned pitifully from all three mouths . annabeth stopped . she turned to face the dog , which had done a one- eighty to look at us . cerberus panted expectantly , the tiny red ball in pieces in a puddle of drool at its feet . [ 297 ] '' good boy , '' annabeth said , but her voice sounded melancholy and uncertain . the monster 's heads turned sideways , as if worried about her . `` i 'll bring you another ball soon , '' annabeth promised faintly . `` would you like that ? '' the monster whimpered . i did n't need to speak dog to know cerberus was still waiting for the ball . `` good dog . i 'll come visit you soon . i — i promise . '' annabeth turned to us . `` let 's go . '' grover and i pushed through the metal detector , which immediately screamed and set off flashing red lights . `` unauthorized possessions ! magic detected ! '' cerberus started to bark . we burst through the ez death gate , which started even more alarms blaring , and raced into the underworld . a few minutes later , we were hiding , out of breath , in the rotten trunk of an immense black tree as security ghouls scuttled past , yelling for backup from the furies . grover murmured , `` well , percy , what have we learned today ? '' `` that three-headed dogs prefer red rubber balls over sticks ? '' `` no , '' grover told me . `` we 've learned that your plans really , really bite ! `` i was n't sure about that . i thought maybe annabeth and i had both had the right idea . even here in the underworld , everybody — even monsters — needed a little attention once in a while . [ 298 ] i thought about that as we waited for the ghouls to pass . i pretended not to see annabeth wipe a tear from her cheek as she listened to the mournful keening of cerberus in the distance , longing for his new friend . [ 299 ] ! 9 l w < e find out th€ truth , f sort of imagine the largest concert crowd you 've ever seen , a foot- ball field packed with a million fans . now imagine a field a million times that big , packed with people , and imagine the electricity has gone out , and there is no noise , no light , no beach ball bouncing around over the crowd . something tragic has happened backstage . whispering masses of people are just milling around in the shadows , waiting for a concert that will never start . if you can picture that , you have a pretty good idea what the fields of asphodel looked like . the black grass had been trampled by eons of dead feet . a warm , moist wind blew like the breath of a swamp . black trees — grover told me they were poplars — grew in clumps here and there . the cavern ceiling was so high above us it might 've been a bank of storm clouds , except for the stalactites , which glowed faint gray and looked wickedly pointed . i tried not to imagine they 'd fall on us at any moment , but dotted around the fields were several that had fallen and impaled themselves in the black grass . i guess the dead did n't have to worry about little hazards like being speared by stalactites the size of booster rockets . annabeth , grover , and i tried to blend into the crowd , [ 300 ] keeping an eye out for security ghouls . i could n't help look- ing for familiar faces among the spirits of asphodel , but the dead are hard to look at . their faces shimmer . they all look slightly angry or confused . they will come up to you and speak , but their voices sound like chatter , like bats twitter- ing . once they realize you ca n't understand them , they frown and move away . the dead are n't scary . they 're just sad . we crept along , following the line of new arrivals that snaked from the main gates toward a black-tented pavilion with a banner that read : judgments for elysium and eternal damnation welcome . newly deceased ! out the back of the tent came two much smaller lines . to the left , spirits flanked by security ghouls were marched down a rocky path toward the fields of punish- ment , which glowed and smoked in the distance , a vast , cracked wasteland with rivers of lava and minefields and miles of barbed wire separating the different torture areas . even from far away , i could see people being chased by hellhounds , burned at the stake , forced to run naked through cactus patches or listen to opera music . i could just make out a tiny hill , with the ant-size figure of sisyphus struggling to move his boulder to the top . and i saw worse tortures , too — things i do n't want to describe . the line coming from the right side of the judgment pavilion was much better . this one led down toward a small valley surrounded by walls — a gated community , which [ 301 ] seemed to be the only happy part of the underworld . beyond the security gate were neighborhoods of beautiful houses from every time period in history , roman villas and medieval castles and victorian mansions . silver and gold flowers bloomed on the lawns . the grass rippled in rainbow colors . i could hear laughter and smell barbecue cooking . elysium . in the middle of that valley was a glittering blue lake , with three small islands like a vacation resort in the bahamas . the isles of the blest , for people who had chosen to be reborn three times , and three times achieved elysium . immediately i knew that 's where i wanted to go when i died . `` that 's what it 's all about , '' annabeth said , like she was reading my thoughts . `` that 's the place for heroes . '' but i thought of how few people there were in elysium , how tiny it was compared to the fields of asphodel or even the fields of punishment . so few people did good in their lives . it was depressing . we left the judgment pavilion and moved deeper into the asphodel fields . it got darker . the colors faded from our clothes . the crowds of chattering spirits began to thin . after a few miles of walking , we began to hear a famil- iar screech in the distance . looming on the horizon was a palace of glittering black obsidian . above the parapets swirled three dark batlike creatures : the furies . i got the feeling they were waiting for us . `` i suppose it 's too late to turn back , '' grover said wist- fully . `` we 'll be okay . '' i tried to sound confident . [ 302 ] '' maybe we should search some of the other places first , '' grover suggested . `` like , elysium , for instance . . `` come on , goat boy . '' annabeth grabbed his arm . grover yelped . his sneakers sprouted wings and his legs shot forward , pulling him away from annabeth . he landed flat on his back in the grass . `` grover , '' annabeth chided . `` stop messing around . '' `` but i did n't — `` he yelped again . his shoes were flapping like crazy now . they levitated off the ground and started dragging him away from us . `` matal `` he yelled , but the magic word seemed to have no effect . `` maia , already ! n ine - one - one ! help ! ” i got over being stunned and made a grab for grover 's hand , but too late . he was picking up speed , skidding downhill like a bobsled . we ran after him . annabeth shouted , `` untie the shoes ! '' it was a smart idea , but i guess it 's not so easy when your shoes are pulling you along feetfirst at full speed . grover tried to sit up , but he could n't get close to the laces . we kept after him , trying to keep him in sight as he zipped between the legs of spirits who chattered at him in annoyance . i was sure grover was going to barrel straight through the gates of hades 's palace , but his shoes veered sharply to the right and dragged him in the opposite direction . the slope got steeper . grover picked up speed . annabeth [ 303 ] and i had to sprint to keep up . the cavern walls narrowed on either side , and i realized wed entered some kind of side tun- nel . no black grass or trees now , just rock underfoot , and the dim light of the stalactites above . `` grover ! '' i yelled , my voice echoing . `` hold on to something ! `` `` what ? '' he yelled back . he was grabbing at gravel , but there was nothing big enough to slow him down . the tunnel got darker and colder . the hairs on my arms bristled . it smelled evil down here . it made me think of things i should n't even know about — blood spilled on an ancient stone altar , the foul breath of a murderer . then i saw what was ahead of us , and i stopped dead in my tracks . the tunnel widened into a huge dark cavern , and in the middle was a chasm the size of a city block . grover was sliding straight toward the edge . `` come on , percy ! '' annabeth yelled , tugging at my wrist . `` but that 's — `` '' i know ! '' she shouted . `` the place you described in your dream ! but grover 's going to fall if we do n't catch him . '' she was right , of course . grover 's predicament got me moving again . he was yelling , clawing at the ground , but the winged shoes kept dragging him toward the pit , and it did n't look like we could possibly get to him in time . what saved him were his hooves . the flying sneakers had always been a loose fit on him , [ 304 ] and finally grover hit a big rock and the left shoe came flying off . it sped into the darkness , down into the chasm . the right shoe kept tugging him along , but not as fast . grover was able to slow himself down by grabbing on to the big rock and using it like an anchor . he was ten feet from the edge of the pit when we caught him and hauled him back up the slope . the other winged shoe tugged itself off , circled around us angrily and kicked our heads in protest before flying off into the chasm to join its twin . we all collapsed , exhausted , on the obsidian gravel . my limbs felt like lead . even my backpack seemed heavier , as if somebody had filled it with rocks . grover was scratched up pretty bad . his hands were bleeding . his eyes had gone slit-pupiled , goat style , the way they did whenever he was terrified . `` i do n't know how . . . '' he panted . `` i did n't . . . '' `` wait , '' i said . `` listen . '' i heard something — a deep whisper in the darkness . another few seconds , and annabeth said , `` percy , this place — `` '' shh . '' i stood . the sound was getting louder , a muttering , evil voice from far , far below us . coming from the pit . grover sat up . `` wh — what 's that noise ? '' annabeth heard it too , now . i could see it in her eyes . `` tartarus . the entrance to tartarus . '' i uncapped anaklusmos . the bronze sword expanded , gleaming in the darkness . [ 305 ] and the evil voice seemed to falter , just for a moment , before resuming its chant . i could almost make out words now , ancient , ancient words , older even than greek . as if . . . `` magic , '' i said . `` we have to get out of here , '' annabeth said . together , we dragged grover to his hooves and started back up the tunnel . my legs would n't move fast enough . my backpack weighed me down . the voice got louder and angrier behind us , and we broke into a run . not a moment too soon . a cold blast of wind pulled at our backs , as if the entire pit were inhaling . for a terrifying moment , i lost ground , my feet slipping in the gravel . if we 'd been any closer to the edge , we would 've been sucked in . we kept struggling forward , and finally reached the top of the tunnel , where the cavern widened out into the fields of asphodel . the wind died . a wail of outrage echoed from deep in the tunnel . something was not happy we 'd gotten away . `` what was that ? '' grover panted , when we 'd collapsed in the relative safety of a black poplar grove . `` one of hades 's pets ? '' annabeth and i looked at each other . i could tell she was nursing an idea , probably the same one she 'd gotten during the taxi ride to l.a .. but she was too scared to share it . that was enough to terrify me . i capped my sword , put the pen back in my pocket . `` let 's keep going . '' i looked at grover . `` can you walk ? '' [ 306 ] he swallowed . `` yeah , sure . i never liked those shoes , anyway. `` he tried to sound brave about it , but he was trembling as badly as annabeth and i were . whatever was in that pit was nobody 's pet . it was unspeakably old and powerful . even echidna had n't given me that feeling . i was almost relieved to turn my back on that tunnel and head toward the palace of hades . almost . the furies circled the parapets , high in the gloom . the outer walls of the fortress glittered black , and the two- story-tall bronze gates stood wide open . up close , i saw that the engravings on the gates were scenes of death . some were from modern times — an atomic bomb exploding over a city , a trench filled with gas mask- wearing soldiers , a line of african famine victims waiting with empty bowls — but all of them looked as if they 'd been etched into the bronze thousands of years ago . i wondered if i was looking at prophecies that had come true . inside the courtyard was the strangest garden i 'd ever seen . multicolored mushrooms , poisonous shrubs , and weird luminous plants grew without sunlight . precious jew- els made up for the lack of flowers , piles of rubies as big as my fist , clumps of raw diamonds . standing here and there like frozen party guests were medusa 's garden statues — petrified children , satyrs , and centaurs — all smiling gro- tesquely . in the center of the garden was an orchard of [ 307 ] pomegranate trees , their orange blooms neon bright in the dark . `` the garden of persephone , '' annabeth said . `` keep walking. `` i understood why she wanted to move on . the tart smell of those pomegranates was almost overwhelming . i had a sudden desire to eat them , but then i remembered the story of persephone . one bite of underworld food , and we would never be able to leave . i pulled grover away to keep him from picking a big juicy one . we walked up the steps of the palace , between black columns , through a black marble portico , and into the house of hades . the entry hall had a polished bronze floor , which seemed to boil in the reflected torchlight . there was no ceiling , just the cavern roof , far above . i guess they never had to worry about rain down here . every side doorway was guarded by a skeleton in mili- tary gear . some wore greek armor , some british redcoat uniforms , some camouflage with tattered american flags on the shoulders . they carried spears or muskets or m-16s . none of them bothered us , but their hollow eye sockets fol- lowed us as we walked down the hall , toward the big set of doors at the opposite end . two u.s. marine skeletons guarded the doors . they grinned down at us , rocket-propelled grenade launchers held across their chests . `` you know , '' grover mumbled , `` i bet hades does n't have trouble with door-to-door salesmen . '' my backpack weighed a ton now . i could n't figure out why . i wanted to open it , check to see if i had [ 308 ] somehow picked up a stray bowling ball , but this was n't the time . `` well , guys , '' i said . `` i suppose we should . knock ? '' a hot wind blew down the corridor , and the doors swung open . the guards stepped aside . `` i guess that means entrez-vous , '' annabeth said . the room inside looked just like in my dream , except this time the throne of hades was occupied . he was the third god i 'd met , but the first who really struck me as godlike . he was at least ten feet tall , for one thing , and dressed in black silk robes and a crown of braided gold . his skin was albino white , his hair shoulder-length and jet black . he was n't bulked up like ares , but he radiated power . he lounged on his throne of fused human bones , looking lithe , graceful , and dangerous as a panther . i immediately felt like he should be giving the orders . he knew more than i did . he should be my master . then i told myself to snap out of it . hades 's aura was affecting me , just as ares 's had . the lord of the dead resembled pictures i 'd seen of adolph hitler , or napoleon , or the terrorist leaders who direct sui- cide bombers . hades had the same intense eyes , the same kind of mesmerizing , evil charisma . `` you are brave to come here , son of poseidon , '' he said in an oily voice . `` after what you have done to me , very brave indeed . or perhaps you are simply very foolish . '' numbness crept into my joints , tempting me to lie [ 309 ] down and just take a little nap at hades 's feet . curl up here and sleep forever . i fought the feeling and stepped forward . 1 knew what i had to say . `` lord and uncle , i come with two requests . '' hades raised an eyebrow . when he sat forward in his throne , shadowy faces appeared in the folds of his black robes , faces of torment , as if the garment were stitched of trapped souls from the fields of punishment , trying to get out . the adhd part of me wondered , off-task , whether the rest of his clothes were made the same way . what hor- rible things would you have to do in your life to get woven into hades 's underwear ? `` only two requests ? '' hades said . `` arrogant child . as if you have not already taken enough . speak , then . it amuses me not to strike you dead yet . '' i swallowed . this was going about as well as i 'd feared . i glanced at the empty , smaller throne next to hades 's . it was shaped like a black flower , gilded with gold . i wished queen persephone were here . i recalled something in the myths about how she could calm her husband 's moods . but it was summer . of course , persephone would be above in the world of light with her mother , the goddess of agri- culture , demeter . her visits , not the tilt of the planet , create the seasons . annabeth cleared her throat . her finger prodded me in the back . `` lord hades , '' i said . `` look , sir , there ca n't be a war among the gods . it would be . . . bad . '' `` really bad , '' grover added helpfully . [ 310 ] '' return zeus 's master bolt to me , '' i said . `` please , sir . let me carry it to olympus . '' hades 's eyes grew dangerously bright . `` you dare keep up this pretense , after what you have done ? '' i glanced back at my friends . they looked as confused as i was . `` um . . . uncle , '' i said . `` you keep saying 'after what you 've done . ' what exactly have i done ? '' the throne room shook with a tremor so strong , they probably felt it upstairs in los angeles . debris fell from the cavern ceiling . doors burst open all along the walls , and skeletal warriors marched in , hundreds of them , from every time period and nation in western civilization . they lined the perimeter of the room , blocking the exits . hades bellowed , `` do you think i want war , godling ? '' i wanted to say , well , these guys do n't look like peace activists . but i thought that might be a dangerous answer . `` you are the lord of the dead , '' i said carefully . `` a war would expand your kingdom , right ? '' `` a typical thing for my brothers to say ! do you think i need more subjects ? did you not see the sprawl of the asphodel fields ? '' `` well . . . '' `` have you any idea how much my kingdom has swollen in this past century alone , how many subdivisions i 've had to open ? '' i opened my mouth to respond , but hades was on a roll now . `` more security ghouls , '' he moaned . `` traffic problems [ 311 ] at the judgment pavilion . double overtime for the staff . i used to be a rich god , percy jackson . i control all the pre- cious metals under the earth . but my expenses ! '' `` charon wants a pay raise , '' i blurted , just remembering the fact . as soon as i said it , i wished i could sew up my mouth . `` do n't get me started on charon ! '' hades yelled . `` he 's been impossible ever since he discovered italian suits ! problems everywhere , and i 've got to handle all of them personally . the commute time alone from the palace to the gates is enough to drive me insane ! and the dead just keep arriving . no , godling . i need no help getting subjects ! i did not ask for this war . '' `` but you took zeus 's master bolt . '' `` lies ! '' more rumbling . hades rose from his throne , towering to the height of a football goalpost . `` your father may fool zeus , boy , but i am not so stupid . i see his plan . '' `` his plan ? '' `` you were the thief on the winter solstice , '' he said . `` your father thought to keep you his little secret . he directed you into the throne room on olympus . you took the master bolt and my helm . had i not sent my fury to discover you at yancy academy , poseidon might have suc- ceeded in hiding his scheme to start a war . but now you have been forced into the open . you will be exposed as poseidon 's thief , and i will have my helm back ! '' `` but . . . '' annabeth spoke . i could tell her mind was going a million miles an hour . `` lord hades , your helm of darkness is missing , too ? '' [ 312 ] '' do not play innocent with me , girl . you and the satyr have been helping this hero — coming here to threaten me in poseidon 's name , no doubt — to bring me an ultimatum . does poseidon think i can be blackmailed into supporting him ? '' `` no ! '' i said . `` poseidon did n't — i did n't — `` '' i have said nothing of the helm 's disappearance , '' hades snarled , `` because i had no illusions that anyone on olympus would offer me the slightest justice , the slightest help . i can ^11 afford for word to get out that my most pow- erful weapon of fear is missing . so i searched for you myself , and when it was clear you were coming to me to deliver your threat , i did not try to stop you . '' `` you did n't try to stop us ? but — `` '' return my helm now , or i will stop death , '' hades threatened . `` that is my counterproposal . i will open the earth and have the dead pour back into the world . i will make your lands a nightmare . and you , percy jackson — your skeleton will lead my army out of hades . '' the skeletal soldiers all took one step forward , making their weapons ready . at that point , i probably should have been terrified . the strange thing was , i felt offended . nothing gets me angrier than being accused of something i did n't do . i 've had a lot of experience with that . `` you 're as bad as zeus , '' i said . `` you think i stole from you ? that 's why you sent the furies after me ? '' `` of course , '' hades said . `` and the other monsters ? '' hades curled his lip . `` i had nothing to do with them . i [ 313 ] wanted no quick death for you — i wanted you brought before me alive so you might face every torture in the fields of punishment . why do you think i let you enter my king- dom so easily ? '' `` easily ? '' `` return my property ! '' `` but i do n't have your helm . i came for the master bolt . '' `` which you already possess ! '' hades shouted . `` you came here with it , little fool , thinking you could you threaten me ! '' `` but i did n't ! '' `` open your pack , then . '' a horrible feeling struck me . the weight in my back- pack , like a bowling ball . it could n't be . . . . i slung it off my shoulder and unzipped it . inside was a two -foot-long metal cylinder , spiked on both ends , hum- ming with energy . `` percy , '' annabeth said . `` how — `` '' i — i do n't know . i do n't understand . '' `` you heroes are always the same , ” hades said . `` your pride makes you foolish , thinking you could bring such a weapon before me . i did not ask for zeus 's master bolt , but since it is here , you will yield it to me . i am sure it will make an excellent bargaining tool . and now . . . my helm . where is it ? '' i was speechless . i had no helm . i had no idea how the master bolt had gotten into my backpack . i wanted to think hades was pulling some kind of trick . hades was the bad guy . but suddenly the world turned sideways . i realized i 'd been played with . zeus , poseidon , and hades had been set [ 314 ] at each others throats by someone else . the master bolt had been in the backpack , and id gotten the backpack from . . . `` lord hades , wait , '' i said . `` this is all a mistake . '' `` a mistake ? '' hades roared . the skeletons aimed their weapons . from high above , there was a fluttering of leathery wings , and the three furies swooped down to perch on the back of their master 's throne . the one with mrs. dodds 's face grinned at me eagerly and flicked her whip . `` there is no mistake , '' hades said . `` i know why you have come — i know the real reason you brought the bolt . you came to bargain for her '' hades loosed a ball of gold fire from his palm . it exploded on the steps in front of me , and there was my mother , frozen in a shower of gold , just as she was at the moment when the minotaur began to squeeze her to death . i could n't speak . i reached out to touch her , but the light was as hot as a bonfire . `` yes , '' hades said with satisfaction . `` i took her . i knew , percy jackson , that you would come to bargain with me eventually . return my helm , and perhaps i will let her go . she is not dead , you know . not yet . but if you displease me , that will change . '' i thought about the pearls in my pocket . maybe they could get me out of this . if i could just get my mom free . . . `` ah , the pearls , '' hades said , and my blood froze . `` yes , my brother and his little tricks . bring them forth , percy jackson. `` [ 315 ] my hand moved against my will and brought out the pearls . `` only three , '' hades said . `` what a shame . you do realize each only protects a single person . try to take your mother , then , little godling . and which of your friends will you leave behind to spend eternity with me ? go on . choose . or give me the backpack and accept my terms . '' i looked at annabeth and grover . their faces were grim . `` we were tricked , '' i told them . `` set up . '' `` yes , but why ? '' annabeth asked . `` and the voice in the pit- '' '' i do n't know yet , '' i said . `` but i intend to ask . '' `` decide , boy ! '' hades yelled . `` percy . '' grover put his hand on my shoulder . `` you ca n't give him the bolt . '' `` i know that . '' `` leave me here , '' he said . `` use the third pearl on your mom. `` `` no ! `` `` i 'm a satyr , '' grover said . `` we do n't have souls like humans do . he can torture me until i die , but he wo n't get me forever . i 'll just be reincarnated as a flower or something . it 's the best way . '' `` no . '' annabeth drew her bronze knife . `` you two go on . grover , you have to protect percy . you have to get your searcher 's license and start your quest for pan . get his mom out of here . i 'll cover you . i plan to go down fighting . '' `` no way , '' grover said . `` i 'm staying behind . '' `` think again , goat boy , '' annabeth said . [ 316 ] '' stop it , both of you ! '' i felt like my heart was being ripped in two . they had both been with me through so much . i remembered grover dive-bombing medusa in the statue garden , and annabeth saving us from cerberus ; wed survived hephaestus 's waterland ride , the st. louis arch , the lotus casino . i had spent thousands of miles worried that id be betrayed by a friend , but these friends would never do that . they had done nothing but save me , over and over , and now they wanted to sacrifice their lives for my mom . `` i know what to do , '' i said . `` take these . '' i handed them each a pearl . annabeth said , `` but , percy . . . '' i turned and faced my mother . i desperately wanted to sacrifice myself and use the last pearl on her , but i knew what she would say . she would never allow it . i had to get the bolt back to olympus and tell zeus the truth . i had to stop the war . she would never forgive me if i saved her instead . i thought about the prophecy made at half-blood hill , what seemed like a million years ago . you will fail to save what matters most in the end . `` i 'm sorry , '' i told her . `` i 'll be back . i 'll find a way . '' the smug look on hades 's face faded . he said , '' godling ... ? '' `` i 'll find your helm . uncle , '' i told him . `` i 'll return it . remember about charon 's pay raise . '' `` do not defy me — `` '' and it would n't hurt to play with cerberus once in a while . he likes red rubber balls . '' [ 317 ] '' percy jackson , you will not — `` i shouted , `` now , guys ! '' we smashed the pearls at our feet . for a scary moment , nothing happened . hades yelled , `` destroy them ! '' the army of skeletons rushed forward , swords out , guns clicking to full automatic . the furies lunged , their whips bursting into flame . just as the skeletons opened fire , the pearl fragments at my feet exploded with a burst of green light and a gust of fresh sea wind . i was encased in a milky white sphere , which was starting to float off the ground . annabeth and grover were right behind me . spears and bullets sparked harmlessly off the pearl bubbles as we floated up . hades yelled with such rage , the entire fortress shook and i knew it was not going to be a peaceful night in l.a. '' look up ! '' grover yelled . `` we 're going to crash ! '' sure enough , we were racing right toward the stalactites , which i figured would pop our bubbles and skewer us . `` how do you control these things ? '' annabeth shouted . `` i do n't think you do ! '' i shouted back . we screamed as the bubbles slammed into the ceiling and . . . darkness . were we dead ? no , i could still feel the racing sensation . we were going up , right through solid rock as easily as an air bubble in water . that was the power of the pearls , i realized — what belongs to the sea will always return to the sea . for a few moments , i could n't see anything outside the [ 318 ] smooth walls of my sphere , then my pearl broke through on the ocean floor . the two other milky spheres , annabeth and grover , kept pace with me as we soared upward through the water . and — ker-blam ! we exploded on the surface , in the middle of the santa monica bay , knocking a surfer off his board with an indig- nant , `` dude ! '' i grabbed grover and hauled him over to a life buoy . i caught annabeth and dragged her over too . a curious shark was circling us , a great white about eleven feet long . i said , `` beat it . '' the shark turned and raced away . the surfer screamed something about bad mushrooms and paddled away from us as fast as he could . somehow , i knew what time it was : early morning , june 21 , the day of the summer solstice . in the distance , los angeles was on fire , plumes of smoke rising from neighborhoods all over the city . there had been an earthquake , all right , and it was hades 's fault . he was probably sending an army of the dead after me right now . but at the moment , the underworld was n't my biggest problem . i had to get to shore . i had to get zeus 's thunderbolt back to olympus . most of all , i had to have a serious con- versation with the god who 'd tricked me . [ 319 ] 20 l i battl6 my 7 j€ri < r€lativ€ a coast guard boat picked us up , but they were too busy to keep us for long , or to wonder how three kids in street clothes had gotten out into the middle of the bay . there was a disas- ter to mop up . their radios were jammed with distress calls . they dropped us off at the santa monica pier with towels around our shoulders and water bottles that said i 'm a junior coast guard ! and sped off to save more people . our clothes were sopping wet , even mine . when the coast guard boat had appeared , id silently prayed they would n't pick me out of the water and find me perfectly dry , which might 've raised some eyebrows . so i 'd willed myself to get soaked . sure enough , my usual waterproof magic had abandoned me . i was also barefoot , because i 'd given my shoes to grover . better the coast guard wonder why one of us was barefoot than wonder why one of us had hooves . after reaching dry land , we stumbled down the beach , watching the city burn against a beautiful sunrise . i felt as if i 'd just come back from the dead — which i had . my back- pack was heavy with zeus 's master bolt . my heart was even heavier from seeing my mother . `` i do n't believe it , '' annabeth said . `` we went all that way — `` [ 320 ] '' it was a trick , '' i said . `` a strategy worthy of athena . '' `` hey , '' she warned . `` you get it , do n't you ? '' she dropped her eyes , her anger fading . `` yeah . i get it . '' `` well , i do n't ! '' grover complained . `` would some- body — `` '' percy . . . '' annabeth said . `` i 'm sorry about your mother . i 'm so sorry . . . . '' i pretended not to hear her . if i talked about my mother , i was going to start crying like a little kid . `` the prophecy was right , '' i said . `` you shall go west and face the god who has turned . ' but it was n't hades . hades did n't want war among the big three . someone else pulled off the theft . someone stole zeus 's master bolt , and hades 's helm , and framed me because i 'm poseidon 's kid . poseidon will get blamed by both sides . by sundown today , there will be a three-way war . and i 'll have caused it . '' grover shook his head , mystified . `` but who would be that sneaky ? who would want war that bad ? '' i stopped in my tracks , looking down the beach . `` gee , let me think . '' there he was , waiting for us , in his black leather duster and his sunglasses , an aluminum baseball bat propped on his shoulder . his motorcycle rumbled beside him , its head- light turning the sand red . `` hey , kid , '' ares said , seeming genuinely pleased to see me . `` you were supposed to die . '' `` you tricked me , '' i said . `` you stole the helm and the master bolt . '' [ 321 ] ares grinned . `` well , now , i did n't steal them person- ally . gods taking each other 's symbols of power — that 's a big no-no . but you 're not the only hero in the world who can run errands . '' `` who did you use ? clarisse ? she was there at the win- ter solstice . '' the idea seemed to amuse him . `` does n't matter . the point is , kid , you 're impeding the war effort . see , you 've got to die in the underworld . then old seaweed will be mad at hades for killing you . corpse breath will have zeus 's master bolt , so zeus 'll be mad at him . and hades is still looking for this . . . '' from his pocket he took out a ski cap — the kind bank robbers wear — and placed it between the handlebars of his bike . immediately , the cap transformed into an elaborate bronze war helmet . `` the helm of darkness , '' grover gasped . `` exactly , '' ares said . `` now where was i ? oh yeah , hades will be mad at both zeus and poseidon , because he does n't know who took this . pretty soon , we got a nice lit- tle three-way slugfest going . '' `` but they 're your family ! '' annabeth protested . ares shrugged . `` best kind of war . always the blood- iest . nothing like watching your relatives fight , i always say . `` you gave me the backpack in denver , '' i said . `` the master bolt was in there the whole time . '' `` yes and no , '' ares said . `` it 's probably too complicated for your little mortal brain to follow , but the backpack [ 322 ] is the master bolt 's sheath , just morphed a bit . the bolt is connected to it , sort of like that sword you got , kid . it always returns to your pocket , right ? '' i was n't sure how ares knew about that , but i guess a god of war had to make it his business to know about weapons . `` anyway , '' ares continued , `` i tinkered with the magic a bit , so the bolt would only return to the sheath once you reached the underworld . you get close to hades . . . . bingo , you got mail . if you died along the way — no loss . i still had the weapon . '' `` but why not just keep the master bolt for yourself ? '' i said . `` why send it to hades ? '' ares got a twitch in his jaw . for a moment , it was almost as if he were listening to another voice , deep inside his head . `` why did n't i . . . yeah . . . with that kind of fire- power . . . '' he held the trance for one second . . . two seconds . . . . i exchanged nervous looks with annabeth . ares 's face cleared . `` i did n't want the trouble . better to have you caught redhanded , holding the thing . '' `` you 're lying , '' i said . `` sending the bolt to the underworld was n't your idea , was it ? '' `` of course it was ! '' smoke drifted up from his sun- glasses , as if they were about to catch fire . `` you did n't order the theft , '' i guessed . `` someone else sent a hero to steal the two items . then , when zeus sent you to hunt him down , you caught the thief . but you did n't turn him over to zeus . something convinced you to let him go . [ 323 ] you kept the items until another hero could come along and complete the delivery . that thing in the pit is ordering you around . '' `` i am the god of war ! i take orders from no one ! i do n't have dreams ! '' i hesitated . `` who said anything about dreams ? '' ares looked agitated , but he tried to cover it with a smirk . `` let 's get back to the problem at hand , kid . you 're alive . i ca n't have you taking that bolt to olympus . you just might get those hardheaded idiots to listen to you . so i 've got to kill you . nothing personal . '' he snapped his fingers . the sand exploded at his feet and out charged a wild boar , even larger and uglier than the one whose head hung above the door of cabin seven at camp half-blood . the beast pawed the sand , glaring at me with beady eyes as it lowered its razor-sharp tusks and waited for the command to kill . i stepped into the surf . `` fight me yourself . ares . '' he laughed , but i heard a little edge to his laughter . . . an uneasiness . `` you 've only got one talent , kid , running away . you ran from the chimera . you ran from the under- world . you do n't have what it takes . '' `` scared ? '' `` in your adolescent dreams . '' but his sunglasses were starting to melt from the heat of his eyes . `` no direct involvement . sorry , kid . you 're not at my level . '' annabeth said , `` percy , run ! '' the giant boar charged . [ 324 ] but i was done running from monsters . or hades , or ares , or anybody . as the boar rushed me , i uncapped my pen and side- stepped . riptide appeared in my hands . i slashed upward . the boar 's severed right tusk fell at my feet , while the disoriented animal charged into the sea . i shouted , `` wave ! '' immediately , a wave surged up from nowhere and engulfed the boar , wrapping around it like a blanket . the beast squealed once in terror . then it was gone , swallowed by the sea . i turned back to ares . `` are you going to fight me now ? '' i asked . `` or are you going to hide behind another pet ares 's face was purple with rage . `` watch it , kid . i could turn you into — `` '' a cockroach , '' i said . `` or a tapeworm . yeah , i 'm sure . that 'd save you from getting your godly hide whipped , would n't it ? '' flames danced along the top of his glasses . `` oh . man , you are really asking to be smashed into a grease spot . '' `` if i lose , turn me into anything you want . take the bolt . if i win , the helm and the bolt are mine and you have to go away . '' ares sneered . he swung the baseball bat off his shoulder . `` how would you like to get smashed : classic or modern ? '' i showed him my sword . `` that 's cool , dead boy , '' he said . `` classic it is . '' the [ 325 ] baseball bat changed into a huge , two-handed sword . the hilt was a large silver skull with a ruby in its mouth . `` percy , '' annabeth said . `` do n't do this . he 's a god . '' `` he 's a coward , '' i told her . she swallowed . `` wear this , at least . for luck . '' she took off her necklace , with her five years ' worth of camp beads and the ring from her father , and tied it around my neck . `` reconciliation . '' she said . `` athena and poseidon together. `` my face felt a little warm , but i managed a smile . `` thanks. `` `` and take this , '' grover said . he handed me a flattened tin can that he 'd probably been saving in his pocket for a thousand miles . `` the satyrs stand behind you . '' `` grover ... i do n't know what to say . '' he patted me on the shoulder . i stuffed the tin can in my back pocket . `` you all done saying good-bye ? '' ares came toward me , his black leather duster trailing behind him , his sword glint- ing like fire in the sunrise . `` i 've been fighting for eternity , kid . my strength is unlimited and i can not die . what have you got ? '' a smaller ego , i thought , but i said nothing . i kept my feet in the surf , backing into the water up to my ankles . i thought back to what annabeth had said at the denver diner , so long ago : ares has strength . that 's all he has . even strength has to bow to wisdom sometimes . he cleaved downward at my head , but i was n't there . [ 326 ] my body thought for me . the water seemed to push me into the air and i catapulted over him , slashing as i came down . but ares was just as quick . he twisted , and the strike that should 've caught him directly in the spine was deflected off the end of his sword hilt . he grinned . `` not bad . not bad . '' he slashed again and i was forced to jump onto dry land . i tried to sidestep , to get back to the water , but ares seemed to know what i wanted . he outmaneuvered me , pressing so hard i had to put all my concentration on not getting sliced into pieces . i kept backing away from the surf . i could n't find any openings to attack . his sword had a reach several feet longer than anaklusmos . get in close , luke had told me once , back in our sword class . when you 've got the shorter blade , get in close . i stepped inside with a thrust , but ares was waiting for that . he knocked my blade out of my hands and kicked me in the chest . i went airborne — twenty , maybe thirty feet . i would 've broken my back if i had n't crashed into the soft sand of a dune . `` percy ! '' annabeth yelled . `` cops ! '' i was seeing double . my chest felt like it had just been hit with a battering ram , but i managed to get to my feet . i could n't look away from ares for fear he 'd slice me in half , but out of the corner of my eye i saw red lights flash- ing on the shoreline boulevard . car doors were slamming . `` there , officer ! '' somebody yelled . `` see ? '' a gruff cop voice : `` looks like that kid on tv . . . what the heck . . . '' [ 327 ] '' that guy 's armed , '' another cop said . `` call for backup. `` i rolled to one side as ares 's blade slashed the sand . i ran for my sword , scooped it up , and launched a swipe at ares 's face , only to find my blade deflected again . ares seemed to know exactly what i was going to do the moment before i did it . i stepped back toward the surf , forcing him to follow . `` admit it , kid , '' ares said . `` you got no hope . i 'm just toying with you . '' my senses were working overtime . i now understood what annabeth had said about adhd keeping you alive in battle . i was wide awake , noticing every little detail . i could see where ares was tensing . i could tell which way he would strike . at the same time , i was aware of annabeth and grover , thirty feet to my left . i saw a second cop car pulling up , siren wailing . spectators , people who had been wandering the streets because of the earthquake , were starting to gather . among the crowd , i thought i saw a few who were walking with the strange , trotting gait of disguised satyrs . there were shimmering forms of spirits , too , as if the dead had risen from hades to watch the battle . i heard the flap of leathery wings circling somewhere above . more sirens . i stepped farther into the water , but ares was fast . the tip of his blade ripped my sleeve and grazed my forearm . a police voice on a megaphone said , `` drop the guns ! set them on the ground . now ! '' guns ? [ 328 ] i looked at ares 's weapon , and it seemed to be flicker- ing ; sometimes it looked like a shotgun , sometimes a two- handed sword . i did n't know what the humans were seeing in my hands , but i was pretty sure it would n't make them like me . ares turned to glare at our spectators , which gave me a moment to breathe . there were five police cars now , and a line of officers crouching behind them , pistols trained on us . `` this is a private matter ! '' ares bellowed . `` be gone ! '' he swept his hand , and a wall of red flame rolled across the patrol cars . the police barely had time to dive for cover before their vehicles exploded . the crowd behind them scat- tered , screaming . ares roared with laughter . `` now , little hero . let 's add you to the barbecue . '' he slashed . i deflected his blade . i got close enough to strike , tried to fake him out with a feint , but my blow was knocked aside . the waves were hitting me in the back now . ares was up to his thighs , wading in after me . i felt the rhythm of the sea , the waves growing larger as the tide rolled in , and suddenly i had an idea . little waves , i thought . and the water behind me seemed to recede . i was holding back the tide by force of will , but tension was building , like carbonation behind a cork . ares came toward , grinning confidently . i lowered my blade , as if i were too exhausted to go on . wait for it , i told the sea . the pressure now was almost lifting me off my feet . ares raised his sword . i released the tide and jumped , rock- eting straight over ares on a wave . [ 329 ] a six-foot wall of water smashed him full in the face , leaving him cursing and sputtering with a mouth full of sea- weed . i landed behind him with a splash and feinted toward his head , as id done before . he turned in time to raise his sword , but this time he was disoriented , he did n't anticipate the trick . i changed direction , lunged to the side , and stabbed riptide straight down into the water , sending the point through the god 's heel . the roar that followed made hades 's earthquake look like a minor event . the very sea was blasted back from ares , leaving a wet circle of sand fifty feet wide . ichor , the golden blood of the gods , flowed from a gash in the war god 's boot . the expression on his face was beyond hatred . it was pain , shock , complete disbelief that he 'd been wounded . he limped toward me , muttering ancient greek curses . something stopped him . it was as if a cloud covered the sun , but worse . light faded . sound and color drained away . a cold , heavy pres- ence passed over the beach , slowing time , dropping the temperature to freezing , and making me feel like life was hopeless , fighting was useless . the darkness lifted . ares looked stunned . police cars were burning behind us . the crowd of spec- tators had fled . annabeth and grover stood on the beach , in shock , watching the water flood back around ares 's feet , his glowing golden ichor dissipating in the tide . ares lowered his sword . [ 330 ] '' you have made an enemy , godling , '' he told me . `` you have sealed your fate . every time you raise your blade in bat- tle , every time you hope for success , you will feel my curse . beware , perseus jackson . beware . '' his body began to glow . `` percy ! '' annabeth shouted . `` do n't watch ! '' i turned away as the god ares revealed his true immor- tal form . i somehow knew that if i looked , i would disin- tegrate into ashes . the light died . i looked back . ares was gone . the tide rolled out to reveal hades 's bronze helm of darkness . i picked it up and walked toward my friends . but before i got there , i heard the flapping of leathery wings . three evil-looking grandmothers with lace hats and fiery whips drifted down from the sky and landed in front of me . the middle fury , the one who had been mrs. dodds , stepped forward . her fangs were bared , but for once she did n't look threatening . she looked more disappointed , as if she 'd been planning to have me for supper , but had decided i might give her indigestion . `` we saw the whole thing , '' she hissed . `` so ... it truly was not you ? '' i tossed her the helmet , which she caught in surprise . `` return that to lord hades , '' i said . `` tell him the truth . tell him to call off the war . '' she hesitated , then ran a forked tongue over her green , leathery lips . `` live well , percy jackson . become a true hero . [ 331 ] because if you do not , if you ever come into my clutches again . . she cackled , savoring the idea . then she and her sisters rose on their bats ' wings , fluttered into the smoke-filled sky , and disappeared . i joined grover and annabeth , who were staring at me in amazement . `` percy . . grover said . `` that was so incredibly . . `` terrifying , '' said annabeth . `` cool ! '' grover corrected . i did n't feel terrified . i certainly did n't feel cool . i was tired and sore and completely drained of energy . `` did you guys feel that . . . whatever it was ? '' i asked . they both nodded uneasily . `` must 've been the furies overhead , '' grover said . but i was n't so sure . something had stopped ares from killing me , and whatever could do that was a lot stronger than the furies . i looked at annabeth , and an understanding passed between us . i knew now what was in that pit , what had spo- ken from the entrance oftartarus . i reclaimed my backpack from grover and looked inside . the master bolt was still there . such a small thing to almost cause world war iii . `` we have to get back to new york , '' i said . `` by tonight. `` `` that 's impossible , '' annabeth said , `` unless we — `` '' fly , '' i agreed . she stared at me . `` fly , like , in an airplane , which you [ 332 ] were warned never to do lest zeus strike you out of the sky , and carrying a weapon that has more destructive power than a nuclear bomb ? '' `` yeah , '' i said . `` pretty much exactly like that . come on . '' [ 333 ] 21 ♦ i s€ttl€ my tab it 's funny how humans can wrap their mind around things and fit them into their version of reality . chiron had told me that long ago . as usual , i did n't appreciate his wisdom until much later . according to the l.a. news , the explosion at the santa monica beach had been caused when a crazy kidnapper fired a shotgun at a police car . he accidentally hit a gas main that had ruptured during the earthquake . this crazy kidnapper ( a.k.a . ares ) was the same man who had abducted me and two other adolescents in new york and brought us across country on a ten-day odyssey of terror . poor little percy jackson was n't an international crimi- nal after all . he 'd caused a commotion on that greyhound bus in new jersey trying to get away from his captor ( and afterward , witnesses would even swear they had seen the leather-clad man on the bus — `` why did n't i remember him before ? '' ) . the crazy man had caused the explosion in the st. louis arch . after all , no kid could 've done that . a con- cerned waitress in denver had seen the man threatening his abductees outside her diner , gotten a friend to take a photo , and notified the police . finally , brave percy jackson ( i was [ 334 ] beginning to like this kid ) had stolen a gun from his captor in los angeles and battled him shotgun-to-rifle on the beach . police had arrived just in time . but in the spectacu- lar explosion , five police cars had been destroyed and the captor had fled . no fatalities had occurred . percy jackson and his two friends were safely in police custody . the reporters fed us this whole story . we just nodded and acted tearful and exhausted ( which was n't hard ) , and played victimized kids for the cameras . `` all i want , '' i said , choking back my tears , `` is to see my loving stepfather again . every time i saw him on tv , calling me a delinquent punk , i knew . . . somehow . . . we would be okay . and i know he 'll want to reward each and every person in this beautiful city of los angeles with a free major appliance from his store . here 's the phone number . '' the police and reporters were so moved that they passed around the hat and raised money for three tickets on the next plane to new york . i knew there was no choice but to fly . i hoped zeus would cut me some slack , considering the circumstances . but it was still hard to force myself on board the flight . takeoff was a nightmare . every spot of turbulence was scarier than a greek monster . i did n't unclench my hands from the armrests until we touched down safely at la guardia . the local press was waiting for us outside security , but we managed to evade them thanks to annabeth , who lured them away in her invisible yankees cap , shouting , '' they 're over by the frozen yogurt ! come on ! , '' then re- joined us at baggage claim . [ 335 ] we split up at the taxi stand . i told annabeth and grover to get back to half-blood hill and let chiron know what had happened . they protested , and it was hard to let them go after all wed been through , but i knew i had to do this last part of the quest by myself . if things went wrong , if the gods did n't believe me ... i wanted annabeth and grover to survive to tell chiron the truth . i hopped in a taxi and headed into manhattan . thirty minutes later , i walked into the lobby of the empire state building . i must have looked like a homeless kid , with my tattered clothes and my scraped-up face . i had n't slept in at least twenty-four hours . i went up to the guard at the front desk and said , `` six hundredth floor. `` he was reading a huge book with a picture of a wizard on the front . i was n't much into fantasy , but the book must 've been good , because the guard took a while to look up . `` no such floor , kiddo . '' `` i need an audience with zeus . '' he gave me a vacant smile . `` sorry ? '' `` you heard me . '' i was about to decide this guy was just a regular mortal , and i 'd better run for it before he called the straitjacket patrol , when he said , `` no appointment , no audience , kiddo . lord zeus does n't see anyone unannounced . '' `` oh , i think he 'll make an exception . '' i slipped off my backpack and unzipped the top . [ 336 ] the guard looked inside at the metal cylinder , not get- ting what it was for a few seconds . then his face went pale . `` that is n't . . . '' `` yes , it is , '' i promised . `` you want me take it out and — `` '' no ! no ! '' he scrambled out of his seat , fumbled around his desk for a key card , then handed it to me . `` insert this in the security slot . make sure nobody else is in the ele- vator with you . '' i did as he told me . as soon as the elevator doors closed , i slipped the key into the slot . the card disappeared and a new button appeared on the console , a red one that said 600 . i pressed it and waited , and waited . muzak played . `` raindrops keep falling on my head . . . . '' finally , ding . the doors slid open . i stepped out and almost had a heart attack . i was standing on a narrow stone walkway in the mid- dle of the air . below me was manhattan , from the height of an airplane . in front of me , white marble steps wound up the spine of a cloud , into the sky . my eyes followed the stairway to its end , where my brain just could not accept what i saw . look again , my brain said . we 're looking , my eyes insisted . it 's really there . from the top of the clouds rose the decapitated peak of a mountain , its summit covered with snow . clinging to the mountainside were dozens of multileveled palaces — a city of mansions — all with white-columned porticos , gilded terraces , and bronze braziers glowing with a thousand fires . [ 337 ] roads wound crazily up to the peak , where the largest palace gleamed against the snow . precariously perched gar- dens bloomed with olive trees and rosebushes . i could make out an open-air market filled with colorful tents , a stone amphitheater built on one side of the mountain , a hippo- drome and a coliseum on the other . it was an ancient greek city , except it was n't in ruins . it was new , and clean , and col- orful , the way athens must 've looked twenty-five hundred years ago . this place ca n't be here , i told myself . the tip of a mountain hanging over new york city like a billion-ton asteroid ? how could something like that be anchored above the empire state building , in plain sight of millions of people , and not get noticed ? but here it was . and here i was . my trip through olympus was a daze . i passed some giggling wood nymphs who threw olives at me from their garden . hawkers in the market offered to sell me ambrosia- on-a-stick . and a new shield , and a genuine glitter-weave replica of the golden fleece , as seen on hephaestus-tv the nine muses were tuning their instruments for a concert in the park while a small crowd gathered — satyrs and naiads and a bunch of good-looking teenagers who might 've been minor gods and goddesses . nobody seemed worried about an impending civil war . in fact , everybody seemed in a fes- tive mood . several of them turned to watch me pass , and whispered to themselves . i climbed the main road , toward the big palace at the peak . it was a reverse copy of the palace in the underworld . [ 338 ] there , everything had been black and bronze . here , every- thing glittered white and silver . i realized hades must 've built his palace to resemble this one . he was n't welcomed in olympus except on the winter solstice , so he 'd built his own olympus underground . despite my bad experience with him , i felt a little sorry for the guy . to be banished from this place seemed really unfair . it would make anybody bitter . steps led up to a central courtyard . past that , the throne room . room really is n't the right word . the place made grand central station look like a broom closet . massive columns rose to a domed ceiling , which was gilded with moving con- stellations . twelve thrones , built for beings the size of hades , were arranged in an inverted u , just like the cabins at camp half-blood . an enormous fire crackled in the central hearth pit . the thrones were empty except for two at the end : the head throne on the right , and the one to its imme- diate left . i did n't have to be told who the two gods were that were sitting there , waiting for me to approach . i came toward them , my legs trembling . the gods were in giant human form , as hades had been , but i could barely look at them without feeling a tingle , as if my body were starting to burn . zeus , the lord of the gods , wore a dark blue pinstriped suit . he sat on a simple throne of solid platinum . he had a well-trimmed beard , marbled gray and black like a storm cloud . his face was proud and handsome and grim , his eyes rainy gray . [ 339 ] as i got nearer to him , the air crackled and smelled of ozone . the god sitting next to him was his brother , without a doubt , but he was dressed very differently . he reminded me of a beachcomber from key west . he wore leather sandals , khaki bermuda shorts , and a tommy bahama shirt with coconuts and parrots all over it . his skin was deeply tanned , his hands scarred like an old-time fisherman 's . his hair was black , like mine . his face had that same brooding look that had always gotten me branded a rebel . but his eyes , sea- green like mine , were surrounded by sun-crinkles that told me he smiled a lot , too . his throne was a deep-sea fisherman 's chair . it was the simple swiveling kind , with a black leather seat and a built- in holster for a fishing pole . instead of a pole , the holster held a bronze trident , flickering with green light around the tips . the gods were n't moving or speaking , but there was ten- sion in the air , as if they 'd just finished an argument . i approached the fisherman 's throne and knelt at his feet . `` father . '' i dared not look up . my heart was racing . i could feel the energy emanating from the two gods . if i said the wrong thing , i had no doubt they could blast me into dust . to my left , zeus spoke . `` should you not address the master of this house first , boy ? '' i kept my head down , and waited . `` peace , brother , '' poseidon finally said . his voice stirred my oldest memories : that warm glow i remembered as a [ 340 ] baby , the sensation of this god 's hand on my forehead . `` the boy defers to his father . this is only right . '' `` you still claim him then ? '' zeus asked , menacingly . `` you claim this child whom you sired against our sacred oath ? '' `` i have admitted my wrongdoing , '' poseidon said . `` now i would hear him speak . '' wrongdoing . a lump welled up in my throat . was that all i was ? a wrongdoing ? t h e result of a god 's mistake ? `` i have spared him once already . '' zeus grumbled . `` daring to fly through my domain . . . pah ! i should have blasted him out of the sky for his impudence . '' `` and risk destroying your own master bolt ? '' poseidon asked calmly . `` let us hear him out , brother . '' zeus grumbled some more . `` i shall listen , '' he decided . `` then i shall make up my mind whether or not to cast this boy down from olympus . '' `` perseus , '' poseidon said . `` look at me . '' i did , and i was n't sure what i saw in his face . there was no clear sign of love or approval . nothing to encourage me . it was like looking at the ocean : some days , you could tell what mood it was in . most days , though , it was unreadable , mysterious . i got the feeling poseidon really did n't know what to think of me . he did n't know whether he was happy to have me as a son or not . in a strange way , i was glad that poseidon was so distant . if he 'd tried to apologize , or told me he loved me , or even smiled , it would 've felt fake . like a [ 341 ] human dad , making some lame excuse for not being around . i could live with that . after all , i was n't sure about him yet , either . 'address lord zeus , boy , '' poseidon told me . `` tell him your story . '' so i told zeus everything , just as it had happened . i took out the metal cylinder , which began sparking in the sky god 's presence , and laid it at his feet . there was a long silence , broken only by the crackle of the hearth fire . zeus opened his palm . the lightning bolt flew into it . as he closed his fist , the metallic points flared with elec- tricity , until he was holding what looked more like the clas- sic thunderbolt , a twenty-foot javelin of arcing , hissing energy that made the hairs on my scalp rise . `` i sense the boy tells the truth , '' zeus muttered . `` but that ares would do such a thing ... it is most unlike him . '' `` he is proud and impulsive , '' poseidon said . `` it runs in the family . '' `` lord ? '' i asked . they both said , `` yes ? '' `` ares did n't act alone . someone else — something else — came up with the idea . '' i described my dreams , and the feeling i 'd had on the beach , that momentary breath of evil that had seemed to stop the world , and made ares back off from kill- ing me . `` in the dreams , '' i said , `` the voice told me to bring the bolt to the underworld . ares hinted that he 'd been having [ 342 ] dreams , too . i think he was being used , just as i was , to start a war . '' `` you are accusing hades , after all ? '' zeus asked . `` no , '' i said . `` i mean . lord zeus , i 've been in the pres- ence of hades . this feeling on the beach was different . it was the same thing i felt when i got close to that pit . that was the entrance to tartarus , was n't it ? something powerful and evil is stirring down there . . . something even older than the gods . '' poseidon and zeus looked at each other . they had a quick , intense discussion in ancient greek . i only caught one word . father . poseidon made some kind of suggestion , but zeus cut him off . poseidon tried to argue . zeus held up his hand angrily . `` we will speak of this no more , '' zeus said . `` i must go personally to purify this thunderbolt in the waters of lemnos , to remove the human taint from its metal . '' he rose and looked at me . his expression softened just a fraction of a degree . `` you have done me a service , boy . few heroes could have accomplished as much . '' `` i had help , sir , '' i said . `` grover underwood and annabeth chase — `` '' to show you my thanks , i shall spare your life . i do not trust you , perseus jackson . i do not like what your arrival means for the future of olympus . but for the sake of peace in the family , i shall let you live . '' `` um . . . thank you , sir . '' `` do not presume to fly again . do not let me find you [ 343 ] here when i return . otherwise you shall taste this bolt . and it shall be your last sensation . '' thunder shook the palace . with a blinding flash of lightning , zeus was gone . i was alone in the throne room with my father . `` your uncle , '' poseidon sighed , `` has always had a flair for dramatic exits . i think he would 've done well as the god of theater . '' an uncomfortable silence . `` sir , '' i said , `` what was in that pit ? '' poseidon regarded me . `` have you not guessed ? '' `` kronos , '' i said . `` the king of the titans . '' even in the throne room of olympus , far away from tartarus , the name kronos darkened the room , made the hearth fire seem not quite so warm on my back . poseidon gripped his trident . `` in the first war , percy , zeus cut our father kronos into a thousand pieces , just as kronos had done to his own father , ouranos . zeus cast kronos 's remains into the darkest pit of tartarus . t h e titan army was scattered , their mountain fortress on etna destroyed , their monstrous allies driven to the farthest cor- ners of the earth . and yet titans can not die , any more than we gods can . whatever is left of kronos is still alive in some hideous way , still conscious in his eternal pain , still hunger- ing for power . '' `` he 's healing , '' i said . `` he 's coming back . '' poseidon shook his head . `` from time to time , over the eons , kronos has stirred . he enters men 's nightmares and breathes evil thoughts . he wakens restless monsters from [ 344 ] the depths . but to suggest he could rise from the pit is another thing . '' `` that 's what he intends . father . that 's what he said . '' poseidon was silent for a long time . `` lord zeus has closed discussion on this matter . he will not allow talk of kronos . you have completed your quest , child . that is all you need to do . '' `` but — `` i stopped myself . arguing would do no good . it would very possibly anger the only god who i had on my side . `` as ... as you wish . father . '' a faint smile played on his lips . `` obedience does not come naturally to you . does it ? '' `` no . . . sir . '' `` i must take some blame for that . i suppose . the sea does not like to be restrained . '' he rose to his full height and took up his trident . then he shimmered and became the size of a regular man . standing directly in front of me . `` you must go , child . but first , know that your mother has returned . '' i stared at him , completely stunned . `` my mother ? '' `` you will find her at home . hades sent her when you recovered his helm . even the lord of death pays his debts . '' my heart was pounding . i could n't believe it . `` do you . . . wouldyou . . . '' i wanted to ask if poseidon would come with me to see her , but then i realized that was ridiculous . i imagined load- ing the god of the sea into a taxi and taking him to the upper east side . if he 'd wanted to see my mom all these years , he would have . and there was smelly gabe to think about . [ 345 ] poseidon 's eyes took on a little sadness . `` when you return home , percy , you must make an important choice . you will find a package waiting in your room . '' `` a package ? '' `` you will understand when you see it . no one can choose your path , percy . you must decide . '' i nodded , though i did n't know what he meant . `` your mother is a queen among women , '' poseidon said wistfully . `` i had not met such a mortal woman in a thou- sand years . still ... i am sorry you were born , child . i have brought you a hero 's fate , and a hero 's fate is never happy . it is never anything but tragic . '' i tried not to feel hurt . here was my own dad , telling me he was sorry i 'd been born . `` i do n't mind . father . '' `` not yet , perhaps , '' he said . `` not yet . but it was an unforgivable mistake on my part . '' `` i 'll leave you then . '' i bowed awkwardly . `` i — i wo n't bother you again . '' i was five steps away when he called , `` perseus . '' i turned . there was a different light in his eyes , a fiery kind of pride . `` you did well , perseus . do not misunderstand me . whatever else you do , know that you are mine . you are a true son of the sea god . '' as i walked back through the city of the gods , conver- sations stopped . the muses paused their concert . people and satyrs and naiads all turned toward me , their faces filled with respect and gratitude , and as i passed , they knelt , as if i were some kind of hero . [ 346 ] fifteen minutes later , still in a trance , i was back on the streets of manhattan . i caught a taxi to my mom 's apartment , rang the door- bell , and there she was — my beautiful mother , smelling of peppermint and licorice , the weariness and worry evaporat- ing from her face as soon as she saw me . `` percy ! oh , thank goodness . oh , my baby . '' she crushed the air right out of me . we stood in the hallway as she cried and ran her hands through my hair . i 'll admit it — my eyes were a little misty , too . i was shaking , i was so relieved to see her . she told me she 'd just appeared at the apartment that morning , scaring gabe half out of his wits . she did n't remember anything since the minotaur , and could n't believe it when gabe told her i was a wanted criminal , traveling across the country , blowing up national monuments . she 'd been going out of her mind with worry all day because she had n't heard the news . gabe had forced her to go into work , saying she had a month 's salary to make up and she 'd better get started . i swallowed back my anger and told her my own story . i tried to make it sound less scary than it had been , but that was n't easy . i was just getting to the fight with ares when gabe 's voice interrupted from the living room . `` hey , sally ! that meat loaf done yet or what ? '' she closed her eyes . `` he is n't going to be happy to see you , percy . the store got half a million phone calls today from los angeles . . . something about free appliances . '' [ 347 ] '' oh , yeah . about that . . she managed a weak smile . `` just do n't make him angrier , all right ? come on . '' in the month i 'd been gone , the apartment had turned into gabeland . garbage was ankle deep on the carpet . the sofa had been reupholstered in beer cans . dirty socks and underwear hung off the lampshades . gabe and three of his big goony friends were playing poker at the table . when gabe saw me , his cigar dropped out of his mouth . his face got redder than lava . `` you got nerve com- ing here , you little punk . i thought the police — `` '' he 's not a fugitive after all , '' my mom interjected . `` is n't that wonderful , gabe ? '' gabe looked back and forth between us . he did n't seem to think my homecoming was so wonderful . `` bad enough i had to give back your life insurance money , sally , '' he growled . `` get me the phone . i 'll call the cops. `` `` gabe , no ! '' he raised his eyebrows . `` did you just say 'no ' l you think i 'm gon na put up with this punk again ? i can still press charges against him for ruining my camaro . '' `` b ut — `` he raised his hand , and my mother flinched . for the first time , i realized something . gabe had hit my mother . i did n't know when , or how much . but i was sure he 'd done it . maybe it had been going on for years , when i was n't around . [ 348 ] a balloon of anger started expanding in my chest . i came toward gabe , instinctively taking my pen out of my pocket . he just laughed . `` what , punk ? you gon na write on me ? you touch me , and you are going to jail forever , you under- stand ? '' `` hey , gabe , '' his friend eddie interrupted . `` he 's just a kid . '' gabe looked at him resentfully and mimicked in a falsetto voice : `` just a kid . '' his other friends laughed like idiots . `` i 'll be nice to you , punk . '' gabe showed me his tobacco- stained teeth . `` i 'll give you five minutes to get your stuff and clear out . after that . i call the police . '' `` gabe ! '' my mother pleaded . `` he ran away , '' gabe told her . `` let him stay gone . '' i was itching to uncap riptide , but even if i did , the blade would n't hurt humans . and gabe , by the loosest def- inition , was human . my mother took my arm . `` please , percy . come on . we 'll go to your room . '' i let her pull me away , my hands still trembling with rage . my room had been completely filled with gabe 's junk . there were stacks of used car batteries , a rotting bouquet of sympathy flowers with a card from somebody who 'd seen his barbara walters interview . `` gabe is just upset , honey , '' my mother told me . `` i 'll talk to him later . i 'm sure it will work out . '' [ 349 ] '' mom , it 'll never work out . not as long as gabe 's here . '' she wrung her hands nervously . `` i can . . . i 'll take you to work with me for the rest of the summer . in the fall , maybe there 's another boarding school — `` '' mom. `` she lowered her eyes . `` i 'm trying , percy . i just ... i need some time . '' a package appeared on my bed . at least , i could 've sworn it had n't been there a moment before . it was a battered cardboard box about the right size to fit a basketball . the address on the mailing slip was in my own handwriting : “ the ? ooc/s mouioe olympus 6 > ooih floor , empire s-hfre boilc/ito^ neoo yorp , ny \fjhb b & sb uoi skes , peroy ctaokson over the top in black marker , in a man 's clear , bold print , was the address of our apartment , and the words : return to sender . suddenly i understood what poseidon had told me on olympus . a package . a decision . whatever else you do , know that you are mine . you are a true son of the sea god . 1350 ] i looked at my mother . `` mom , do you want gabe gone ? '' `` percy , it is n't that simple . i — `` '' mom , just tell me . that jerk has been hitting you . do you want him gone or not ? '' she hesitated , then nodded almost imperceptibly . `` yes , percy . i do . and i 'm trying to get up my courage to tell him . but you ca n't do this for me . you ca n't solve my problems . '' i looked at the box . i could solve her problem . i wanted to slice that package open , plop it on the poker table , and take out what was inside . i could start my very own statue garden , right there in the living room . that 's what a greek hero would do in the stories , i thought . that 's what gabe deserves . but a hero 's story always ended in tragedy . poseidon had told me that . i remembered the underworld . i thought about gabe 's spirit drifting forever in the fields of asphodel , or con- demned to some hideous torture behind the barbed wire of the fields of punishment — an eternal poker game , sitting up to his waist in boiling oil listening to opera music . did i have the right to send someone there ? even gabe ? a month ago , i would n't have hesitated . now . . . `` i can do it , '' i told my mom . `` one look inside this box , and he 'll never bother you again . '' she glanced at the package , and seemed to understand immediately . `` no , percy , '' she said , stepping away . `` you ca n't . [ 351 ] '' poseidon called you a queen , '' i told her . `` he said he had n't met a woman like you in a thousand years . '' her cheeks flushed . `` percy — `` '' you deserve better than this , mom . you should go to college , get your degree . you can write your novel , meet a nice guy maybe , live in a nice house . you do n't need to pro- tect me anymore by staying with gabe . let me get rid of him . '' she wiped a tear off her cheek . `` you sound so much like your father , '' she said . `` he offered to stop the tide for me once . he offered to build me a palace at the bottom of the sea . he thought he could solve all my problems with a wave of his hand . '' `` what 's wrong with that ? '' her multicolored eyes seemed to search inside me . `` i think you know , percy . i think you 're enough like me to understand . if my life is going to mean anything , i have to live it myself . i ca n't let a god take care of me ... or my son . i have to . . . find the courage on my own . your quest has reminded me of that . '' we listened to the sound of poker chips and swearing , espn from the living room television . `` i 'll leave the box , '' i said . `` if he threatens you . . . '' she looked pale , but she nodded . `` where will you go , percy ? '' `` half-blood hill . '' `` for the summer ... or forever ? '' `` i guess that depends . '' we locked eyes , and i sensed that we had an agreement . [ 352 ] we would see how things stood at the end of the summer . she kissed my forehead . `` you 'll be a hero , percy . you 'll be the greatest of all . '' i took one last look around my bedroom . i had a feel- ing i 'd never see it again . then i walked with my mother to the front door . `` leaving so soon , punk ? '' gabe called after me . `` good riddance. `` i had one last twinge of doubt . how could i turn down the perfect chance to take revenge on him ? i was leaving here without saving my mother . `` hey , sally , '' he yelled . `` what about that meat loaf , huh ? '' a steely look of anger flared in my mother 's eyes , and i thought , just maybe , i was leaving her in good hands after all . her own . `` the meat loaf is coming right up , dear , '' she told gabe . `` meat loaf surprise . '' she looked at me , and winked . the last thing i saw as the door swung closed was my mother staring at gabe , as if she were contemplating how he would look as a garden statue . [ 353 ] 22 l thc prophecy 7 comes truc we were the first heroes to return alive to half-blood hill since luke , so of course everybody treated us as if wed won some reality -tv contest . according to camp tradition , we wore laurel wreaths to a big feast prepared in our honor , then led a procession down to the bonfire , where we got to burn the burial shrouds our cabins had made for us in our absence . annabeth 's shroud was so beautiful — gray silk with embroidered owls — i told her it seemed a shame not to bury her in it . she punched me and told me to shut up . being the son of poseidon , i did n't have any cabin mates , so the ares cabin had volunteered to make my shroud . they 'd taken an old bedsheet and painted smiley faces with x'ed-out eyes around the border , and the word loser painted really big in the middle . it was fun to burn . as apollo 's cabin led the sing-along and passed out s'mores , i was surrounded by my old hermes cabinmates , annabeth 's friends from athena , and grover 's satyr buddies , who were admiring the brand-new searcher 's license he 'd received from the council of cloven elders . the council had called grover 's performance on the quest `` brave to the [ 354 ] point of indigestion . horns-and-whiskers above anything we have seen in the past . '' the only ones not in a party mood were clarisse and her cabinmates , whose poisonous looks told me they 'd never forgive me for disgracing their dad . that was okay with me . even dionysus 's welcome -ho me speech was n't enough to dampen my spirits . `` yes , yes , so the little brat did n't get himself killed and now he 'll have an even bigger head . well , huzzah for that . in other announcements , there will be no canoe races this saturday . . . . '' i moved back into cabin three , but it did n't feel so lonely anymore . i had my friends to train with during the day . at night , i lay awake and listened to the sea , knowing my father was out there . maybe he was n't quite sure about me yet , maybe he had n't even wanted me born , but he was watching . and so far , he was proud of what i 'd done . as for my mother , she had a chance at a new life . her letter arrived a week after i got back to camp . she told me gabe had left mysteriously — disappeared off the face of the planet , in fact . she 'd reported him missing to the police , but she had a funny feeling they would never find him . on a completely unrelated subject , she 'd sold her first life-size concrete sculpture , entitled the poker player , to a collector , through an art gallery in soho . she 'd gotten so much money for it , shed put a deposit down on a new apartment and made a payment on her first semester 's tuition at nyu . the soho gallery was clamoring for more [ 355 ] of her work , which they called `` a huge step forward in super-ugly neorealism . '' but do n't worry , my mom wrote . i 'm done with sculpture . i 've disposed of that box of tools you left me . it 's time for me to turn to writing . at the bottom , she wrote a p.s . : percy , i 've found a good pri- vate school here in the city . i 've put a deposit down to hold you a spot , in case you want to enroll for seventh grade . you could live at home . but if you want to go year-round at half-blood hill , i 'll understand . i folded the note carefully and set it on my bedside table . every night before i went to sleep , i read it again , and i tried to decide how to answer her . on the fourth of july , the whole camp gathered at the beach for a fireworks display by cabin nine . being hephaestus 's kids , they were n't going to settle for a few lame red-white -and-blue explosions . they 'd anchored a barge offshore and loaded it with rockets the size of patriot missiles . according to annabeth , who 'd seen the show before , the blasts would be sequenced so tightly they 'd look like frames of animation across the sky . the finale was sup- posed to be a couple of hundred-foot-tall spartan warriors who would crackle to life above the ocean , fight a battle , then explode into a million colors . as annabeth and i were spreading a picnic blanket , grover showed up to tell us good-bye . he was dressed in his usual jeans and t-shirt and sneakers , but in the last few weeks he 'd started to look older , almost high- school age . his goatee had gotten thicker . he 'd put on weight . his [ 356 ] horns had grown at least an inch , so he now had to wear his rasta cap all the time to pass as human . `` i 'm off , '' he said . `` i just came to say . . . well , you know. `` i tried to feel happy for him . after all , it was n't every day a satyr got permission to go look for the great god pan . but it was hard saying good-bye . i 'd only known grover a year , yet he was my oldest friend . annabeth gave him a hug . she told him to keep his fake feet on . i asked him where he was going to search first . `` kind of a secret , '' he said , looking embarrassed . `` i wish you could come with me , guys , but humans and pan . . . '' `` we understand , '' annabeth said . `` you got enough tin cans for the trip ? '' `` yeah . '' `` and you remembered your reed pipes ? '' `` jeez , annabeth , '' he grumbled . `` you 're like an old mama goat . '' but he did n't really sound annoyed . he gripped his walking stick and slung a backpack over his shoulder . he looked like any hitchhiker you might see on an american highway — nothing like the little runty boy i used to defend from bullies atyancy academy . `` well , '' he said , `` wish me luck . '' he gave annabeth another hug . he clapped me on the shoulder , then headed back through the dunes . fireworks exploded to life overhead : hercules killing [ 357 ] the nemean lion , artemis chasing the boar , george washington ( who , by the way , was a son of athena ) cross- ing the delaware . `` hey , grover , '' i called . he turned at the edge of the woods . `` wherever you 're going — i hope they make good enchi- ladas . '' grover grinned , and then he was gone , the trees closing around him . `` we 'll see him again , '' annabeth said . i tried to believe it . the fact that no searcher had ever come back in two thousand years . . . well , i decided not to think about that . grover would be the first . he had to be . july passed . i spent my days devising new strategies for capture-the- flag and making alliances with the other cabins to keep the banner out of ares 's hands . i got to the top of the climb- ing wall for the first time without getting scorched by lava . from time to time , i 'd walk past the big house , glance up at the attic windows , and think about the oracle . i tried to convince myself that its prophecy had come to comple- tion . you shall go west , and face the god who has turned . been there , done that — even though the traitor god had turned out to be ares rather than hades . you shall find what was stolen , and see it safe returned . check . one master bolt delivered . one helm of dark- ness back on hades 's oily head . [ 358 ] you shall he betrayed by one who calls you a friend . this line still bothered me . ares had pretended to be my friend , then betrayed me . that must be what the oracle meant . . . . and you shall fail to save what matters most , in the end . i had failed to save my mom , but only because id let her save herself , and i knew that was the right thing . so why was i still uneasy ? the last night of the summer session came all too quickly . the campers had one last meal together . we burned part of our dinner for the gods . at the bonfire , the senior counselors awarded the end-of-summer beads . i got my own leather necklace , and when i saw the bead for my first summer , i was glad the firelight covered my blushing . the design was pitch black , with a sea-green tri- dent shimmering in the center . `` the choice was unanimous , '' luke announced . `` this bead commemorates the first son of the sea god at this camp , and the quest he undertook into the darkest part of the underworld to stop a war ! '' the entire camp got to their feet and cheered . even ares 's cabin felt obliged to stand . athena 's cabin steered annabeth to the front so she could share in the applause . i 'm not sure i 'd ever felt as happy or sad as i did at that moment . i 'd finally found a family , people who cared about me and thought i 'd done something right . and in the morn- ing , most of them would be leaving for the year . * * * [ 359 ] the next morning , i found a form letter on my bedside table . i knew dionysus must 've filled it out , because he stub- bornly insisted on getting my name wrong : d e a r peter johnson , if you intend to stay at camp half-blood year- round , you must inform the big house by noon today . if you do not announce your intentions , we will assume you have vacated your cabin or died a horrible death . cleaning harpies will begin work at sundown . they will be authorized to eat any unregistered campers . all personal articles left behind will be incinerated in the lava pit . have a nice day ! mr. d ( dionysus ) camp director , olympian council # 12 that 's another thing about adhd . deadlines just are n't real to me until i 'm staring one in the face . summer was over , and i still had n't answered my mother , or the camp , about whether i 'd be staying . now i had only a few hours to decide . the decision should have been easy . i mean , nine months of hero training or nine months of sitting in a classroom — duh . but there was my mom to consider . for the first time , i had the chance to live with her for a whole year , without gabe . i had a chance be at home and knock around the city [ 360 ] in my free time . i remembered what annabeth had said so long ago on our quest : the real world is where the monsters are . that 's where you learn whether you 're any good or not . i thought about the fate of thalia , daughter of zeus . i wondered how many monsters would attack me if i left half-blood hill . if i stayed in one place for a whole school year , without chiron or my friends around to help me , would my mother and i even survive until the next summer ? that was assuming the spelling tests and five-paragraph essays did n't kill me . i decided i 'd go down to the arena and do some sword practice . maybe that would clear my head . the campgrounds were mostly deserted , shimmering in the august heat . all the campers were in their cabins pack- ing up , or running around with brooms and mops , getting ready for final inspection . argus was helping some of the aphrodite kids haul their gucci suitcases and makeup kits over the hill , where the camp 's shuttle bus would be waiting to take them to the airport . do n't think about leaving yet , i told myself . just train . i got to the sword-fighters arena and found that luke had had the same idea . his gym bag was plopped at the edge of the stage . he was working solo , whaling on battle dummies with a sword i 'd never seen before . it must 've been a regular steel blade , because he was slashing the dummies ' heads right off , stabbing through their straw-stuffed guts . his orange counselor 's shirt was dripping with sweat . his expression was so intense , his life might 've really been in danger . i watched , fascinated , as he disemboweled the whole [ 361 ] row of dummies , hacking off limbs and basically reducing them to a pile of straw and armor . they were only dummies , but i still could n't help being awed by luke 's skill . the guy was an incredible fighter . it made me wonder , again , how he possibly could 've failed at his quest . finally , he saw me , and stopped mid-swing . `` percy . '' `` um , sorry , '' i said , embarrassed . `` i just — `` '' it 's okay , '' he said , lowering his sword . `` just doing some last-minute practice . '' `` those dummies wo n't be bothering anybody any- more . '' luke shrugged . `` we build new ones every summer . '' now that his sword was n't swirling around , i could see something odd about it . the blade was two different types of metal — one edge bronze , the other steel . luke noticed me looking at it . `` oh , this ? new toy . this is backbiter . '' `` backbiter ? '' luke turned the blade in the light so it glinted wickedly . `` one side is celestial bronze . the other is tempered steel . works on mortals and immortals both . '' i thought about what chiron had told me when i started my quest — that a hero should never harm mortals unless absolutely necessary . `` i did n't know they could make weapons like that . '' `` they probably ca n't , '' luke agreed . `` it 's one of a kind . '' he gave me a tiny smile , then slid the sword into its scabbard . `` listen , i was going to come looking for you . [ 362 ] what do you say we go down to the woods one last time , look for something to fight ? '' i do n't know why i hesitated . i should 've felt relieved that luke was being so friendly . ever since i 'd gotten back from the quest , he 'd been acting a little distant . i was afraid he might resent me for all the attention i 'd gotten . `` you think it 's a good idea ? '' i asked . `` i mean — `` '' aw , come on . '' he rummaged in his gym bag and pulled out a six-pack of cokes . `` drinks are on me . '' i stared at the cokes , wondering where the heck he 'd gotten them . there were no regular mortal sodas at the camp store . no way to smuggle them in unless you talked to a satyr , maybe . of course , the magic dinner goblets would fill with any- thing you want , but it just did n't taste the same as a real coke , straight out of the can . sugar and caffeine . my willpower crumbled . `` sure , '' i decided . `` why not ? '' we walked down to the woods and kicked around for some kind of monster to fight , but it was too hot . all the monsters with any sense must 've been taking siestas in their nice cool caves . we found a shady spot by the creek where i 'd broken clarisse 's spear during my first capture the flag game . we sat on a big rock , drank our cokes , and watched the sunlight in the woods . after a while luke said , `` you miss being on a quest ? '' `` with monsters attacking me every three feet ? are you kidding ? '' [ 363 ] luke raised an eyebrow . `` yeah , i miss it , '' i admitted . `` you ? '' a shadow passed over his face . i was used to hearing from the girls how good-looking luke was , but at the moment , he looked weary , and angry , and not at all handsome . his blond hair was gray in the sunlight . the scar on his face looked deeper than usual . i could imagine him as an old man . `` fve lived at half-blood hill year-round since i was fourteen , '' he told me . `` ever since thalia ... well , you know . i trained , and trained , and trained . i never got to be a nor- mal teenager , out there in the real world . then they threw me one quest , and when i came back , it was like , okay , ride 's over . have a nice life . ' '' he crumpled his coke can and threw into the creek , which really shocked me . one of the first things you learn at camp half-blood is : do n't litter . you 'll hear from the nymphs and the naiads . they 'll get even . you 'll crawl into bed one night and find your sheets filled with centipedes and mud . `` the heck with laurel wreaths , '' luke said . `` i 'm not going to end up like those dusty trophies in the big house attic. `` `` you make it sound like you 're leaving . '' luke gave me a twisted smile . `` oh , i 'm leaving , all right , percy . i brought you down here to say good-bye . '' he snapped his fingers . a small fire burned a hole in the ground at my feet . out crawled something glistening black , about the size of my hand . a scorpion . [ 364 ] i started to go for my pen . `` i would n't , '' luke cautioned . `` pit scorpions can jump up to fifteen feet . its stinger can pierce right through your clothes . you 'll be dead in sixty seconds . '' `` luke , what — `` then it hit me . you will be betrayed by one who calls you a friend . `` you , '' i said . he stood calmly and brushed off his jeans . the scorpion paid him no attention . it kept its beady black eyes on me , clamping its pincers as it crawled onto my shoe . `` i saw a lot out there in the world , percy , '' luke said . `` did n't you feel it — the darkness gathering , the monsters growing stronger ? did n't you realize how useless it all is ? all the heroics — being pawns of the gods . they should 've been overthrown thousands of years ago , but they 've hung on , thanks to us half-bloods . '' i could n't believe this was happening . `` luke . . . you 're talking about our parents , '' i said . he laughed . `` that 's supposed to make me love them ? their precious 'western civilization is a disease , percy . it 's killing the world . the only way to stop it is to burn it to the ground , start over with something more honest . '' `` you 're as crazy as ares . '' his eyes flared . `` ares is a fool . he never realized the true master he was serving . if i had time , percy , i could explain . but i 'm afraid you wo n't live that long . '' the scorpion crawled onto my pants leg . [ 365 ] there had to be a way out of this . i needed time to think . `` kronos , '' i said . `` that 's who you serve . '' the air got colder . `` you should be careful with names , '' luke warned . `` kronos got you to steal the master bolt and the helm . he spoke to you in your dreams . '' luke 's eye twitched . `` he spoke to you , too , percy . you should 've listened . '' `` he 's brainwashing you , luke . '' `` you 're wrong . he showed me that my talents are being wasted . you know what my quest was two years ago , percy ? my father , hermes , wanted me to steal a golden apple from the garden of the hesperides and return it to olympus . after all the training i 'd done , that was the best he could think up . '' `` that 's not an easy quest , '' i said . `` hercules did it . '' `` exactly , '' luke said . `` where 's the glory in repeating what others have done ? all the gods know how to do is replay their past . my heart was n't in it . the dragon in the garden gave me this '' — he pointed angrily at his scar — `` and when i came back , all i got was pity . i wanted to pull olympus down stone by stone right then , but i bided my time . i began to dream of kronos . he convinced me to steal something worthwhile , something no hero had ever had the courage to take . when we went on that winter-solstice field trip , while the other campers were asleep , i snuck into the throne room and took zeus 's master bolt right from his chair . hades 's helm of darkness , too . you would n't believe [ 366 ] how easy it was . the olympians are so arrogant ; they never dreamed someone would dare steal from them . their secu- rity is horrible . i was halfway across new jersey before i heard the storms rumbling , and i knew they 'd discovered my theft . '' the scorpion was sitting on my knee now , staring at me with its glittering eyes . i tried to keep my voice level . `` so why did n't you bring the items to kronos ? '' luke 's smile wavered . `` i ... i got overconfident . zeus sent out his sons and daughters to find the stolen bolt — artemis , apollo , my father , hermes . but it was ares who caught me . i could have beaten him , but i was n't careful enough . he disarmed me , took the items of power , threat- ened to return them to olympus and burn me alive . then kronos 's voice came to me and told me what to say . i put the idea in ares 's head about a great war between the gods . i said all he had to do was hide the items away for a while and watch the others fight . ares got a wicked gleam in his eyes . i knew he was hooked . he let me go , and i returned to olympus before anyone noticed my absence . '' luke drew his new sword . he ran his thumb down the flat of the blade , as if he were hypnotized by its beauty . `` afterward , the lord of the titans . . . h-he punished me with nightmares . i swore not to fail again . back at camp half-blood , in my dreams , i was told that a second hero would arrive , one who could be tricked into taking the bolt and the helm the rest of the way — from ares down to tartarus . '' `` you summoned the hellhound , that night in the forest . '' `` we had to make chiron think the camp was n't safe for [ 367 ] you , so he would start you on your quest . we had to con- firm his fears that hades was after you . and it worked . '' `` the flying shoes were cursed , '' i said . `` they were sup- posed to drag me and the backpack into tartarus. `` `` and they would have , if you 'd been wearing them . but you gave them to the satyr , which was n't part of the plan . grover messes up everything he touches . he even confused the curse . '' luke looked down at the scorpion , which was now sit- ting on my thigh . `` you should have died in tartarus , percy . but do n't worry . i 'll leave you with my little friend to set things right . '' `` thalia gave her life to save you , '' i said , gritting my teeth . `` and this is how you repay her ? '' `` do n't speak of thalia ! '' he shouted . `` the gods hr her die ! that 's one of the many things they will pay for . '' `` you 're being used , luke . you and ares both . do n't lis- ten to kronos . '' `` i 've been used ? '' luke 's voice turned shrill . `` look at yourself . what has your dad ever done for you ? kronos will rise . you 've only delayed his plans . he will cast the olympians into tartarus and drive humanity back to their caves . all except the strongest — the ones who serve him . '' `` call off the bug , '' i said . `` if you 're so strong , fight me yourself. `` luke smiled . `` nice try , percy . but i 'm not ares . you ca n't bait me . my lord is waiting , and he 's got plenty of quests for me to undertake . '' `` luke — `` [ 368 ] '' good-bye , percy . there is a new golden age coming . you wo n't be part of it . '' he slashed his sword in an arc and disappeared in a rip- ple of darkness . the scorpion lunged . i swatted it away with my hand and uncapped my sword . the thing jumped at me and i cut it in half in midair . i was about to congratulate myself until i looked down at my hand . my palm had a huge red welt , oozing and smoking with yellow guck . the thing had gotten me after all . my ears pounded . my vision went foggy . the water , i thought . it healed me before . i stumbled to the creek and submerged my hand , but nothing seemed to happen . the poison was too strong . my vision was getting dark . i could barely stand up . sixty seconds , luke had told me . i had to get back to camp . if i collapsed out here , my body would be dinner for a monster . nobody would ever know what had happened . my legs felt like lead . my forehead was burning . i stum- bled toward the camp , and the nymphs stirred from their trees . `` help , '' i croaked . `` please . . . '' two of them took my arms , pulling me along . i remember making it to the clearing , a counselor shouting for help , a centaur blowing a conch horn . then everything went black . ❖ ❖ ❖ [ 369 ] i woke with a drinking straw in my mouth . i was sipping something that tasted like liquid chocolate-chip cookies . nectar . i opened my eyes . i was propped up in bed in the sickroom of the big house , my right hand bandaged like a club . argus stood guard in the corner . annabeth sat next to me , holding my nectar glass and dabbing a washcloth on my forehead . `` here we are again . '' i said . `` you idiot , '' annabeth said , which is how i knew she was overjoyed to see me conscious . `` you were green and turning gray when we found you . if it were n't for chiron 's healing . . . '' `` now , now , '' chiron 's voice said . `` percy 's constitution deserves some of the credit . '' he was sitting near the foot of my bed in human form , which was why i had n't noticed him yet . his lower half was magically compacted into the wheelchair , his upper half dressed in a coat and tie . he smiled , but his face looked weary and pale , the way it did when he 'd been up all night grading latin papers . `` how are you feeling ? '' he asked . `` like my insides have been frozen , then microwaved . '' `` apt , considering that was pit scorpion venom . now you must tell me , if you can , exactly what happened . '' between sips of nectar , i told them the story . the room was quiet for a long time . `` i ca n't believe that luke . . . '' annabeth 's voice faltered . her expression turned angry and sad . `` yes . yes , i can believe [ 370 ] it . may the gods curse him . . . . he was never the same after his quest . '' `` this must be reported to olympus , '' chiron mur- mured . `` i will go at once . '' `` luke is out there right now , '' i said . `` i have to go after him. `` chiron shook his head . `` no , percy . the gods — `` '' wo n't even talk about kronos , '' i snapped . `` zeus declared the matter closed ! '' `` percy , i know this is hard . but you must not rush out for vengeance . you are n't ready . '' i did n't like it , but part of me suspected chiron was right . one look at my hand , and i knew i was n't going to be sword fighting any time soon . `` chiron . . . your prophecy from the oracle ... it was about kronos , was n't it ? was i in it ? and annabeth ? '' chiron glanced nervously at the ceiling . `` percy , it is n't my place — `` '' you 've been ordered not to talk to me about it , have n't you ? his eyes were sympathetic , but sad . `` you will be a great hero , child . i will do my best to prepare you . but if i 'm right about the path ahead of you . . . '' thunder boomed overhead , rattling the windows . `` all right ! '' chiron shouted . `` fine ! '' he sighed in frustration . `` the gods have their reasons , percy . knowing too much of your future is never a good thing. `` `` we ca n't just sit back and do nothing , '' i said . [ 371 ] '' we will not sit back , '' chiron promised . `` but you must be careful . kronos wants you to come unraveled . he wants your life disrupted , your thoughts clouded with fear and anger . do not give him what he wants . train patiently . your time will come . '' `` assuming i live that long . '' chiron put his hand on my ankle . `` you 'll have to trust me , percy . you will live . but first you must decide your path for the coming year . i can not tell you the right choice . . . . '' i got the feeling that he had a very definite opinion , and it was taking all his willpower not to advise me . `` but you must decide whether to stay at camp half-blood year- round , or return to the mortal world for seventh grade and be a summer camper . think on that . when i get back from olympus , you must tell me your decision . '' i wanted to protest . i wanted to ask him more ques- tions . but his expression told me there could be no more discussion ; he had said as much as he could . `` i 'll be back as soon as i can , '' chiron promised . `` argus will watch over you . '' he glanced at annabeth . `` oh , and , my dear . . . when- ever you 're ready , they 're here . '' `` who 's here ? '' i asked . nobody answered . chiron rolled himself out of the room . i heard the wheels of his chair clunk carefully down the front steps , two at a time . annabeth studied the ice in my drink . `` what 's wrong ? '' i asked her . [ 372 ] '' nothing . '' she set the glass on the table . `` i . . . just took your advice about something . you ... um ... need any- thing ? '' `` yeah . help me up . i want to go outside . '' `` percy , that is n't a good idea . '' i slid my legs out of bed . annabeth caught me before i could crumple to the floor . a wave of nausea rolled over me . annabeth said , `` i told you . . . '' `` i 'm fine , '' i insisted . i did n't want to lie in bed like an invalid while luke was out there planning to destroy the western world . i managed a step forward . then another , still leaning heavily on annabeth . argus followed us outside , but he kept his distance . by the time we reached the porch , my face was beaded with sweat . my stomach had twisted into knots . but i had managed to make it all the way to the railing . it was dusk . the camp looked completely deserted . the cabins were dark and the volleyball pit silent . no canoes cut the surface of the lake . beyond the woods and the straw- berry fields , the long island sound glittered in the last light of the sun . `` what are you going to do ? '' annabeth asked me . `` i do n't know . '' i told her i got the feeling chiron wanted me to stay year-round , to put in more individual training time , but i was n't sure that 's what i wanted . i admitted i 'd feel bad about leaving her alone , though , with only clarisse for com- pany . . . . [ 373 ] annabeth pursed her lips , then said quietly , `` i 'm going home for the year , percy . '' i stared at her . `` you mean , to your dad 's ? '' she pointed toward the crest of half-blood hill . next to thalia 's pine tree , at the very edge of the camp 's magical boundaries , a family stood silhouetted — two little children , a woman , and a tall man with blond hair . they seemed to be waiting . the man was holding a backpack that looked like the one annabeth had gotten from waterland in denver . `` i wrote him a letter when we got back . '' annabeth said . `` just like you suggested . i told him ... i was sorry . i 'd come home for the school year if he still wanted me . he wrote back immediately . we decided . . . we 'd give it another try . '' `` that took guts . '' she pursed her lips . `` you wo n't try anything stupid during the school year , will you ? at least . . . not without sending me an iris-message ? '' i managed a smile . `` i wo n't go looking for trouble . i usually do n't have to . '' `` when i get back next summer , '' she said , `` we 'll hunt down luke . we 'll ask for a quest , but if we do n't get approval , we 'll sneak off and do it anyway . agreed ? '' `` sounds like a plan worthy of athena . '' she held out her hand . i shook it . `` take care , seaweed brain , '' annabeth told me . `` keep your eyes open . '' `` you too , wise girl . '' i watched her walk up the hill and join her family . she [ 374 ] gave her father an awkward hug and looked back at the valley one last time . she touched thalia 's pine tree , then allowed herself to be lead over the crest and into the mortal world . for the first time at camp , i felt truly alone . i looked out at long island sound and i remembered my father saying . the sea does not like to be restrained . i made my decision . i wondered , if poseidon were watching , would he approve of my choice ? `` i 'll be back next summer , '' i promised him . `` i 'll survive until then . after all , i am your son . '' i asked argus to take me down to cabin three , so i could pack my bags for home .
